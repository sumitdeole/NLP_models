✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Palma de Mallorca via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,3,no,3,"  I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden. "
Not Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Paris,November 2022,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4,yes,7,"  The plane was nice. IFE was pretty good. The main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag. The staff in the plane from Chicago to Paris was not very friendly. The staff in the way back from Paris to Chicago was very kind and helpful. Big difference. Lastly, my checked bag didn't make it to Chicago. The staff at Chicago didn't really want to help me. One spent a few moments trying to register a claim, gave up, handed me a card with instructions and walked away. I tried someone else about 15 minutes later, while she was not happy to help, she did complete the claim for me which I appreciated. The bag was delivered to my door, 200 miles from the airport, the next day was was great. I would fly Air France again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manchester to Bangkok via Paris ,November 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  The Manchester to Paris segment was very average with a very poor seat pitch but for a 1hr 20 min flight I could grin and bear it. However the Paris to Bangkok segment was excellent on all counts. The service provided by Aurelie Luche was outstanding, professional and ever so efficient and friendly. The food for the 11hour and twenty minute flight was plentiful and tasty. The overall comfort of the seat was not that outstanding but I have to say that what was my first flight with Air France it certainly won't be my last. Well done to the crew, especially to Aurelie."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200ER,Business,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,November 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Glitch with agent put me in regular window seat, instead of paid exit row. Although plane was near capacity, flight attendant went to great lengths to find me an aisle seat and overhead space for camera equipment. Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row. The pair retails for $250! I thanked her profusely, and offered to send her a photo gift. I hope she replies. This flight crew was very professional, positive and engaging."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mexico City to Paris,November 2022,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,8,"  Wonderful flight. Extremely professional crew and delicious food. I didn't love the seat and found it a bit narrow compared to others, but didn't detract from the experience. Would recommend."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Paris CDG,November 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8," A good return trip to PUJ in the Caribbean with AF from CDG. They have a very solid product. Good quality food -two services - and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch. Cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional. Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English, French and Spanish which was a bit much. Also lights a bit bright at other times. Baggage handling and check in fine on both legs. A good solid product from a classic legacy carrier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Miami to Zanzibar via Paris,August 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,2,"  Air France business class lounge in Zanzibar is non-existent! Air France in Zanzibar does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even if you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure not to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge. When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! That’s called collecting money under false pretences!  I went online to request my gluten-free meal. I called Air France twice to confirm that the meals had been ordered. However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France forgot to provide a gluten free meal. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error. The moral of the story - if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you! That's after you pay the business class fare of $3200!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 190,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Düsseldorf to Paris CDG,October 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,9, Nice short trip on time. We were even served a sandwich and drink on a 45 min flight. Outstanding: due to train delay I arrived at airport just 40 min before flight. Pulled me through first and even baggage arrived.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris Orly to Pointe-à-Pitre,May 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our flight in June 2022 was already late, and once in the plane and already moving on the ground in order to take-off, the crew detected a fuel leak,o we had to ""pass by technical control"", while remaining in the plane. After having waited 1 hour in the aircraft with an obviously upset crew, they finally told us that this aircraft could not fly and that we have to wait in the airport for another aircraft to continue our journey. After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart ""as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew"". So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : ""We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards"". The flight was in June, nothing has been reimbursed so far, and not even my request has been answered by October. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Mauritius to Paris,October 2022,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2,no,6,"  Air France Business Class Mauritius to Paris Boeing 777. Recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me. Meal selection was limited, forgot to serve me dessert. When asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin. When asking for a napkin, I was given a large table cloth. For breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea. Travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals, you need to feel welcomed and pampered. This was not the case for Air France crew on this flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Dubai,October 2022,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,4.0,5,yes,8,  One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard Wi-Fi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 10/10.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Chicago,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,2,"  I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours. The also didn't have internet on a short leg on our way to Barcelona."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Los Angeles,September 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  We got to CDG airport 3 hours before departure, and we had to run to catch the flight. Long lines, some counters were closed while the ground staff was chatting, no sense of urgency from anyone. The supervisor was less helpful than the others. When we landed at LAX, we didn't find our luggage, and AF personnel had no idea of where it was. It was left in front of the house door the following day without even ringing the bell. We found the bag broken and unrepairable and AF only reimbursed us for 15% of the value for a new bag, with no explanation. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Bucharest to Paris,October 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They have cancelled the flight 15 minutes before departure. They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at >than 48 h after the original one. After spending a lot of time listening to their music while waiting for someone to pick up the phone in Customer Care, they hung up the phone in the middle of my question without providing useful information. They seemed very bothered by the fact that I could have used some help."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Hamburg via Paris,July 2022,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We (a family of 4) made a trip to Hamburg in early July and had a stop in Paris. Our first flight had a 2 1/2 hour delay so we couldn’t catch our connection flight. In Paris we spend over 2 hours to find someone feeling responsible for getting us on a new flight. On one of the biggest International Airports in Europe! After a delay of 6 hours we finally arrived in Hamburg, where we recognized that all our 5 Baggage pieces went missing. We immediately made an AHL Report and headed to our Vacation home without any clothes. We made necessity purchases over the 17 day vacation because our baggage still was nowhere to be found. I made a Claim on the Air France Website for those necessity purchases on day 14 of the vacation. After 21 days I made a claim for lost baggage because the baggage still hasn’t arrived. After 28 days 3 of 5 baggages arrived at our home. The remaining 2 haven’t arrived now for over 3 months. The customer Support took forever to just answer and asking simple questions about data that already has been send over and hasn’t paid any compensation yet. They write mails in which they said you have been on a totally wrong flight on a wrong date. For example they wrote we have been on a flight from Paris to Havana on October 11. Somehow they even closed the claim for the missing baggage although 2 pieces are still missing and on the date of the claim 3 pieces have been already missing for over 21 days. Their Website states that after 21 days you’re baggage is supposed to be lost and you are qualified for a compensation.  Never again Air France, worst experience ever."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Business,Premium Economy,Bogota to Helsinki via Paris,October 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  I had tried to upgrade from economy to premium economy online, but there was no availability. When I was already seating while the plane was about to leave, the flight attendant came to ask if I still wanted to move to premium economy and pay with my miles. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the extra space on this long night flight. The premium economy seat was comfortable and the service friendly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Montpellier,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,2," An unreliable company, with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements, culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm (see picture)! We finally left with 2h delay (for a 1h flight). No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. In-flight ""business"" meal consisted of nuts, one cookie, and a drink. I don't see the difference with ""economy"". Finally arrived starved, late, having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class, all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Vancouver,September 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France, first Toronto to Paris, after being bumped by WestJet, and taking a flight a few hours later, which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver, with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary, no request was too much, and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I don’t write a lot of reviews, and I usually travel Star Alliance, but for Air France, I’ll gladly make exceptions going forward! I will see Air France in business again in April, to Paris and Lisbon, I cant wait! "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New U=York to Paris,October 2022,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  Very Smooth flight. Seat space is very comfortable for economy, 81 cm much more than others offer. Good entertaining and nice crew. Free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack. Only the snack was bad and only dry bread. Delay one hour but arrived on time. Would fly Air France again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Stuttgart via Paris,October 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,2," New York to Stuttgart via Paris. I had a bad experience, on my flight from New York to Paris. Firstly everything was so uncoordinated, the flight got delayed, even the staff from the plane wasn’t in yet even though the boarding would be in 5 minutes. While we was flying there were many inconveniences. First the AC was so cold that I froze the whole time, secondly we flew at night (0:30) and people wanted to sleep but the lights from the airplane were fully on. It was a longer flight but we didn’t receive much to eat and when they came by with water, tea, coffee they didn’t asked me, just a few passengers."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Seattle,September 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,yes,9," We had the best flight attendants. They were lovely. Very attentive to the passengers, very friendly. We were on flight 338 on September 29 leaving Paris to Seattle at 14:15."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Dubai via Paris,September 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hamburg to Punta Cana via Paris CDG,July 2022,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flights cancelled at short notice, no rebooking options, no compensation. I had to buy a new ticket and it took them over 2 months to refund the previous one. Aircrafts were fine, service was standard for long haul. 3 pieces of luggage delayed for 75 days, no information from their customer service, hard to reach and rude. Worst experience with an airline, they'll never see me again."
Not Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Air France has been improving recently even if I already enjoyed flying this Airline,. CDG could be a small downside for a few people but I've always loved it, even though everything might take a few more minutes, I have always like it because it's beautiful!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Paris via Budapest,April 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The airline sold me a ticket, changing in Paris, but left nowhere near enough time to get through security and run across the airport. It was pretty humiliating, and the staff were incredibly rude. When I complained about it, the customer service lady threatened to cancel my return ticket and actually dismissed me with a 'dusting off her hands' motion. They have completely ignored my request for a refund (it left me £233 out of pocket and with a ruined trip. It took all day just to get home)."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to New York via Paris CDG,January 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My original flight had mechanical problems while in flight, so we diverted to Milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of New York-JFK. It was an awful ordeal. I submitted a delay compensation request back in January, and they finally approved it in September (more than 8 months to process!), but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation. I supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers. They have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point, and now after eight months of waiting, they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount. All I'm asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the European Union. Nothing more, nothing less. "
Not Verified ,A350/E190,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Nuremberg via Paris,September 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Overall, a pleasant flight. The mini croissant served on the E190 was tasty. As for the food on the A350, it was satisfying enough but was not up to my expectations. Flight attendants were smiling."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Paris via Bangaluru,September 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,7," Excellent service at Bengaluru. Due to the short time in b/w transfers one bag did not arrive. However Air France had already sent a list of missing baggage and they informed us whilst we were at the luggage carousel, this saving us time. They tracked where our baggage was and sent it on the next flight. It arrived safely. Very helpful staff at Bengaluru who helped us when we were tired and stressed. Thank you Air France! Re food though it's a different review as the quality was poor, food passed off as Indian, really wasn't food any Indian would eat!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Conakry to London Heathrow via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,2," Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa. Terrible airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,First Class,Montréal to Paris,September 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,9," Excellent flight from Paris to Montréal, I wouldn't have recommended Air France 6 or 7 years ago, but this airline is really improving. The cabin crew was pleasing and careful, the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class. The only negative point is that Paris CDG is really disorganized, it is probably one of the worst airports I've had experienced with Amsterdam AMS in Europe. I really hope that it will improve within the next years."
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Zurich,August 2022,2.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight from Zurich to Paris was an hour late.  My return flight experience was worse: I paid for a Siège Plus (11D) with extra legroom. However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag. Between AF and the useless local transporter, I have wasted two days. Is this how AF treats its passengers? Is a Flying Blue Gold member impressed by this experience? I am very frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism from start to finish. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bangalore via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day. You saved us and we are truly grateful. We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Trondheim to London via Amsterdam,April 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Punta Cana via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to say that the airline and cabin crew were absolutely brilliant. They were very attentive and in hand if we needed them. The inflight food was delicious and tasty, not bland like other airlines. We pre-paid for our seats and we’re very pleased with the extra leg room outbound and the Solo seats coming home. I would like to thank all the staff from check in until when we landed. So professional and quick so the queues were small and manageable. Air France made our holiday more amazing by delivering such a wonderful experience. Thank You."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,Bucharest to New York via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Outstanding service. I have travelled from OTP to JFK via CDG and return in business class. A great experience from the lounge, food, beverages to the comfort of the seat. On the return segment JFK -CDG I was upgraded in La Premiere due to my Platinum Ultimate status. The onboard service was state of the art. The champagne the best I have ever tasted. The FAs and the pursers attitude and service flow less. Looking forward to my next trip with AF."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Prague,August 2022,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage. They weigh both bags and if both bags are even 1KG over their 12 KG weight limit they make you walk back to the Air France check-in area to spend 110 euros and 25 minutes to check one bag (not both bags even though they were both weighed together). This would make sense if the luggage was oversized and didn’t fit in the overhead bins but our small luggage was overweight was because we travel with large books. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Beirut via Manchester / Paris,July 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight for an Air France / Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to Beirut. Once I landed in Beirut airport I notice I'm missing one checked bag so I reached out to the missing luggage office and file claim. 2 days later I got update by email that my bag was found, and it will be forwarded to Beirut. I contacted airport for my bag, and they said my bag did not arrive. 2 days later suddenly the claim I filed in the airport was closed and when I contacted customer service, they didn't know how the claim was closed or who closed it. I filed online claim again, since then I have been calling customer service every day about my luggage with no updates. Nobody could explain how my first claim was closed and keep saying no update on my luggage. I filed claim for necessary purchase but I didn't get any reimbursement, then after 21 days filed claim for lost luggage. I started calling air France every day, I got to speak with supervisor who made clear your bag was lost and there is no way for passenger to talk to claim department unless they call you. I asked how long it takes to get my reimbursement, he said, we have long queue and this might take several months. So they lost my bag with promise they will reimburse me when they decide to do with no timeframe. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris CDG,July 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,4,yes,6,"  We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change. Still, I live in hope that Air France ups its game on the service front."

I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner. Shame on Air France. I've never encountered such incompetence."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,August 2022,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We just had a return flight scheduled via Air France on August 1st. We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags. We are told to return in the morning to pick up our other 2 large checked bags that had been pulled from the plane. We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address. Unbelievable service from Air France. No apologies from anyone or care for the extraordinary mess of lines! One bag has been found but the other is untraceable."

Lounge welcome none, food not eatable, Champagne from a cheap brand. These are the only bad news from 2 flights that went smoothly, with excellent on-board service. 16 years old 777, retrofitted, but showing signals of usage. Small (14 seats) business class cabin, therefore very quiet. Connecting in CDG was made easy, with separate immigration for connecting passengers. Lounge in CDG was packed at 6:00 AM ! As usual MRS baggage delivery at MRS is a shame, with no respect for priority bags. Not AF fault; just bad service form third party services."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Paris ,August 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1," Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir. Avoid Air France's archaic customer service system at all costs."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Paris to Düsseldorf,June 2022,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached. All in all very disappointing."

It was supposed to depart at 11:55 pm and 30 minutes Before we were supposed to take off they canceled it and told us they are going to give us a hotel to stay in until they get us a new flight, but 4 hours waiting in the airport until they got us a hotel in Manhattan witch is an hour away from the airport. After that they told us to pay for everything we need and save a copy of the receipt and send it to the airline for a refund.

This trips' flights with Air France were clearly the worst. We were only on this AF flight with our Delta reservations because of code sharing. Not only were the flight attendants condescending, food inedible and the ground service bizarre,  to add insult to injury, they lost our luggage and cannot locate it. AF's service desk is impossible to get on the phone. I have been trying for a day and a half since we returned to ask about the status of my missing luggage. We called Delta and after a wait of over an hour were told we should have called AF. Finally after a wait of over 2 hours we got a person to speak at AF -- the person manning the phones said they live in a status of perpetual wonderment as to where the luggage was and had certainly no idea where mine was. Frustration, upset, anger, disappointment. I will never fly Air France again. If you have an option, take another airline unless you can pack all your clothes in a carry on. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington, DC to Athens via Paris",June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1," We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you. We were not the only people who spent the night at the airport, there were many families with kids who slept on the floor. Absolutely horrible the way they speak to you and also condescending."

However boarding at Marseille was one of the most messy I have ever seen, due to the lack of instructions of staff. Direct channel from Terminal 2F to Terminal 2E (K), with dedicated immigration and no security check was of great relief. Splendid. Catering at lounge was excellent. Boarding of flight to YUL was also a torture, as we had to wait under the sun (during the heat wave) on a ramp during more than 20 minutes. On the other hand service, food and comfort on AF A350 Business class were exceptional, showing a brutal improvement. Air France could have deserved a 10, if they had learned to board with SQ staff."

A gate between the queue to enter the departure lounge and the lounge itself was left open and one passenger managed to wander through, by-passing the gate agent. Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks). Probably because of the slow boarding process at Heathrow our first leg to CDG operated 25 minutes late, resulting in us having to sprint up and down staircases at CDG to catch our onward flight to Lisbon. Our baggage made it too -- phew! All in all this was a pleasant experience, especially onboard."

I've called the help line over 12 times and have been on hold for upwards of 45 minutes before the line hanging up on me. None of the support options seem to work and I've done my best to be patient, but I would really like an update. On the flight, we were given our meals and for an hour and a half, they let our trays sit there. They didn't pick up the trays for so long that people were helping each other out by holding their trash so they could move about the cabin. The flight attendants were nice, even if not very prompt. They seemed as upset about the situation as we were. I'm still on hold (day 2 trying to speak to someone) as I write this review. "

Air France staff was courteous, attentive and polite. The food was better than I could have imagined, we were served both dinner and breakfast. We flew on the Boeing 777-300ER first row in business class (First Class for this particular plane), the plane was a newer version, has ample leg room with an angled flat bed for comfortable seating. The aircraft was clean and everything in my seating area was in working order. My next trip back to Senegal will be with Air France!"

We were scheduled to leave Italy at 6.10 am on July 12, to catch a connecting flight in Paris to JFK. The night before they changed our flight to 7.45 am so we would miss our connecting flight. Instead of scheduling the next available flight from Paris to JFK, they changed our connecting flight multiple times and in the end, we had a 14 hour delay in the airport. No one communicated the reason for this long delay, we can only assume that they gave our seats away to the passengers that had already been stuck in the airport for 24-48 hours for a plane to JFK. The only compensation Air France offered us was a $31 food voucher for five passengers to hold us over for a fourteen hour delay. It is apparent that this airline is not at all prepared to accommodate the influx of passengers flying their airline and definitely does not respect their passengers time. We will never fly this airline again!"

We were originally going from Lyon to Venice. The new route costed us a delay of more than 2 hours. Each flight we boarded, or checked-in for, we were told they did not have a seat for us until everyone else had boarded. It felt like we had bought last-minute budget tickets and treated less than everybody else. Yet we had spent a large amount to travel to Venice. The entire journey we were still grateful we could fly and hopeful we could get to our destination. It was stressful to say the least. This has been a bad experience and I don't recommend Air France."

Last Saturday, I received a message saying the luggage was found. But I have not received the luggage yet.

This flight was 1.5 hours late, which seems normal for that flight.  AF had tried to throw me off my connecting flight and put me on one for the next day but the check-in girl at BKK managed to reverse it and I made the flight. I asked on exit how far away my next gate was but they didn’t have a clue. A 2-3-2 business class is decades out of date and the cabin crew were men who did their job in a minimalist manner but there was no friendliness or engagement with the passengers, downright miserable. The food felt very overly reheated. There looks like a lot of pages of movies but a lot of it was many copies of the same film, no idea what that was about as you choose your language when you click on play. They get round their terrible performance by using that awful and insulting catch-all phrase, “For operational reasons”. When we landed at CDG there was another plane still at our gate."

The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing. So basically if you take Air France and the baggage is lost during the flight, you will not be able to do anything and no one from Air France can help you."

I knew there were cases of large queues for luggage check-ins and anticipating this, I left for the airport 4 hrs earlier and arrived 3.5hrs earlier than my flight time. And as expected, the line was huge. Despite the fact that they had automatic machines where you could check in your luggage, those machines opened late and 3-5 members of Air France were operating those counters. When the machines started running, people did not know how to use them. For example, if your bag were overweight by a certain threshold, the machine would get stuck. Thus, requiring human interference (or maybe people just didn’t know) to make it start working again. Secondly, the machine did not mention that you need to check in your hand luggage also. So, people had to come back from security. There was also a long line of people printing luggage tags after getting in line. Thus coming back and forth into the queues and stalling the people behind them. There were people just getting in line without waiting for their turn.  Some of the cabin crew were gloomy."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Firenze to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Thank you Air France for providing exceptional customer service. I read these reviews and they mostly appear to be only a bad experience. But my experience had the potential to be bad, but you handled it exceedingly well. My flight from Firenze to CDG was going to arrive late and I would miss my connection. In flight, the attendant told me I was going to miss the connection, my new flight was already booked for the next day, and that I would be provided a hotel and meals. When I arrived every word of this was true. I stayed in a very nice airport hotel (Golden Lotus) that provided exceptional buffet style food, I used the hotel shuttle, and you also gave me a meal voucher as well for the airport. I was concerned leaving my luggage overnight in the airport, but it arrived safely in LAX the following day. You could not have made this any easier, and I was really only delayed about 12 hours in total. I've flown with you 3 times now to Italy and you will always be my first choice. Yes, occasionally I may experience an inconvenience, but I will always remember how you handled this perfectly. My only suggestion for the foreign traveler would be maybe to have a printed map (handed to them by the flight attendant) with the details where the Air France Customer Service kiosk is located, and also where the hotel shuttles are located. It's such a huge airport and this took me a little time to navigate."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Paris via Tunis,June 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3," I take a yearly trip to Tunisia, and I've flown with a lot of airlines over the years. I have encountered delays and issues with flight logistics but it was always handled smoothly and professionally by the airline. This time I tried Air France because they offered a trip without much waiting time before the corresponding flight, and what a huge mistake I made. First trip from Montreal to Paris was cancelled out of nowhere. No explanation was given and the only heads up I got was an email that was filtered as a spam since they sent it through a shady email. They rescheduled that flight for another one that got delayed for 2 hours. No heads up this time and of course no explanation. The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter). Needless to say that this is my first and last trip with AF. I really recommend anybody flying long distance to avoid AF at all costs, they do not seem to be able to handle the logistics of a corresponding trip."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Nice,June 2022,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety. "

Of course the airline lost the luggage and now in Bordeaux they sent an email that one cannot respond to for sending the luggage to our hotel but they gave the wrong number to call back and cannot get in touch to coordinate the lost bag reaching our hotel. 2 days after landing in Bordeaux still no bag. Stay away from this airline, I will never book with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Mumbai to Los Angeles via Paris,June 2022,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3,no,5,"  I was dissatisfied with the business class flight from Paris to Mumbai round trip. The flat bed was more like a recliner seat and my food was not up to the quality. Flight back from Paris to LAX took off late and I was very hungry. Flight attendant gave me menu, I chose salmon, she mentioned that is not available since it has been taken. No issues but when I paid a premium to travel business, should not I expect better. Given vegetarian which was very salty."

The wonderful ladies at the Air France counter at the airport were, through determined shuffling, able to accommodate all of us on the next flight to Vancouver. There was otherwise a real possibility that some of would have had to stay overnight. Kudos to the attentiveness of the Air France agents!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Rome via Paris,May 2022,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Osaka to Rome via Paris. I chose to travel with Air France  because it was the ""cheapest"" and the ""shortest"" route. I would recommend flying with them as the trip was ok, but there are things to improve! Duration of the first flight is 15 hours. Although I was worried for this very long trip, time passed quickly aboard. I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !! A particular appreciation for a female flight attendant on the flight from Osaka, and a male flight attendant on the flight to Rome. Both very kind and helpful."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Montreal,June 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,10,  Just flew from Copenhagen to Paris to Montreal on June 17th. We were behind schedule when we landed at CDG with only a small chance of making our connecting flight that day. My wife made it to the correct gate and was able to board while I ended up at the wrong gate. I would like to offer a huge thank you to Captain Emmanuel Rollier who insisted the plane would not leave until I arrived at the plane. The rest of the crew were equally supportive and helped create a positive ending to what had been a very stressful day. Thanks again to Captain and crew. 
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Vancouver,June 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1,  Horrible service and food. Very dirty bathrooms. The cushions or pillows had stains all over. Old airplane. They asked if I wanted chicken or pasta. I said pasta. They said we don’t have it and left. It’s a disgusting airline.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to mention the name of Mr Sunil Lohat who did a great job by helping us and making our journey very comfortable. I think without the help of this gentleman, it wouldn't have been possible for us to board the flight. Mr Sunil helped us till the last moment and ensured that we board the flight. He did everything which a customer needs during any technical hitches which is not known to the passenger. Hats off to such a committed and helping person.  He really made our day in the time of crisis and now I have landed Toronto without any hassles. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A220-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris CDG to Berlin,April 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,9," One way flight from Paris CDG to Berlin BER in April. A smooth and hassle-free flight on a brand new plane. The Airbus A220 is comfortable and offers free WIFI for Whatsapp and other messengers. Air France gives you a free small sandwich and a drink of your choice, alcoholic beverages included. Airport services were also fine. Check-in and security check in CDG took only a few minutes and in Berlin I got my luggage within 5 minutes. I think currently AF is the best airline in Europe."
Not Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Sint Maarten,June 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Was pleasantly surprised with Air France as I was expecting the worst experience. The aircraft felt up to date, entertainment system worked fine and had plenty of choices. Crew were very friendly and personally greeted us and asked if we needed anything. The meal services were great, the main meal was the best one I had in economy for quite sometime as mostly they are inedible but this was good, chicken with mushrooms and polenta, a small salad with Camargue rice and a delicious small pastry for dessert, coffee and wine. The meal service before landing was presented in a small gift bag and contents were tasty, a nice touch I thought."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington  to Florence via Paris CDG,June 2022,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  Delayed on initial flight for both our departure and return trips. This caused us to miss our connection. Each time Air France made it incredibly difficult to rebook. We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent. I will never take any airline that connects in CDG and will absolutely avoid Air France at all costs. The flight attendants were great and the only positive interactions we had were with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Paris via Heathrow,June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  I flew Air France return for my trip to the UK. Seats were small, service apathetic, CDG was a huge disappointment. On the way back they lost my suitcase, still MIA and no feedback from the airline. You have to hold on the phone for ages, get a surly customer service person or your call dropped."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Seoul via Amsterdam,April 2022,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,2,no,1,"  Air France / KLM lure you with the free change ticket. Unluckily, it's an hoax. To begin with, no matter what's the actual price difference, I was asked to pay an amount of money that equal/ed the price of the full ticket at minimum. Eventually, I decided to accept it and was going to pay to change the ticket for my return flight. while I was shown several options, only a tiny percentage were available to book, maybe 30%. All the rest gave a system error and a message to call their hotline, which cost me a lot of wasted time. When I called the hotline, they told the flight was available, but cost more than the full price of a one way ticket. The actual flight was OK, but this rebooking experience was so disappointing and time consuming that I cannot help but to give KLM a 0."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London Heathrow via Paris,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Awful customer service, who are clearly trained to keep you in a loop of confusion, in hope that you give up on whatever it is you need help with. Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong. It amazes me that big companies like Air France can get away with having no customer service whatsoever."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Toronto,June 2022,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,3,no,1," Paris to Toronto. I spent the last 3 weeks travelling to different parts of Europe. I have taken 5 flights total, including my flight home with Air France. I am extremely disappointed with the airport and baggage situation. I arrived at the airport and had my luggage that was not overweight and my carry on luggage that was 12kg as required and purse. I checked my luggage in and proceeded to the security. When arriving at security they weighed my carry on and indicated I had to add my purse on top. Due to my purse and carry on luggage being 14kg together. They stated my carry on or purse needed to be paid for and put through baggage or I needed to remove items and throw them out. I had to go all the way back and pay for my carry on luggage that did not have a lock and had valuable items in it to be put through with baggage. I spent 85 euros that I had no intention in spending as I ensured to make my luggage and carry on for the weight requirements. I’m extremely disappointed that this occurred and felt it was very uncalled for as this has been the only airline who requires a shoulder purse to be weighted."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Geneva to Buenos Aires via Paris ,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  First leg GVA-CDG was delayed due to circumstances outside of AF's control, I completely understand. But I still managed to get to the gate to my CDG-EZE flight with just 5-10 minutes delay. we arrived to find the plane still at the gate but boarding closed. So AF's team had to deny boarding to the 20+ passengers that arrived just a few minutes late. We were then sent to the AF counter AND were assigned a hotel some 40 minutes drive from the airport (this was almost midnight by then). We were told a shuttle would take us to the hotel. We come out to an empty parking lot, no shuttle in sight. In the end we had to google the hotel's name and pay for a uber to take us there. We arrive to the hotel (which was partially under construction) at around 1AM, and the hotel manager has no idea if and when AF will send a shuttle to bring me back to the airport. AF set me in an Iberia flight via Madrid, so I had to be back at the airport at 5.30AM.  I make it back to the airport, to find out my luggage was not transferred by AF to Iberia, so I would have to leave without it. I spent the next week in Argentina without my luggage, unsuccessfully trying to get information from AF and/or Iberia."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Paris,May 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,5,yes,8,"  Business class cabin is not the newest one in airline industry but still very good. The window seat is spacious with very much room for ones feet (perfect in flat bed mode) and very comfy. I slept very well. Privacy could be a little bit better but will be improved with the new suite type of seats for B777. IFE: Screen size and selection are good, picture quality is not on par with modern systems - but of course you can not expect this. The crew has been very friendly and helpful, food was plenty and delicious with a great starter (picture) and one of the best steaks I ever had on board (sorry, forgot to take a picture). Check in in SFO was very slow (almost 40 minutes for 12 people) but otherwise no complaints. Lounge was small and crowded, but food, beverages and WIFI were very good. I really liked the whole experience and appreciated the attentive and cordial service on board. Well done, Air France. I am looking forward to fly with you again long haul."

Shameful and inexcusable on the part of Air France."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris,May 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,1," Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris. Very disrespectful to their customers. Initially, the return flight was booked for a Saturday evening. But 2 months in advance Air France cancelled the flight. Since there was only one flight a day, we had to reschedule for the Sunday flight. Air France did not want to book a hotel or pay (part of the extra hotel costs). On check-in at Abuja, check-in was denied, because the flight was scheduled for the day before (Saturday), doh. Even though I was carrying the ticket with the new date, the booking confirmation and the e-mail about the cancellation, they refused boarding. At long last, the ticket office printed a new ticket for Sunday, and informed us, that they would not charge us at this time. On arrival in Paris, there was a technical problem with the bridge, which delayed the flight by half an hour. Air France staff refused to assist to help us catch the connecting flight. As a result, we missed the flight. At the transfer counter, the helpful staff informed us of this fact, as if we were to blame for it. On arrival in Amsterdam, of course, our bags were missing. We claimed the missing bags immediately. It took Air France a full week, to deliver the bags (from Paris to Amsterdam). When they eventually delivered the bags, one was damaged (broken handle). We also claimed the damage on the handle immediately. So far it has been 3 weeks, and Air France is not responding to any requests, nor handling our damage claim. I would row a boat to Nigeria than fly with an airline that is so disinterested in their customers. Never again."

They provided one meal ~1.5 hours after the take off and then we were starving as the last one was ~1.5 before landing. Both were unsatisfactory for such a long flight, equal to those offered in 3 hour flights of other airlines such Aegean. Also one of the flight attendants woke us up (4 people) at 4.30am while everyone was sleeping because she wanted to find her bag. She first opened the cases above our seats and after she realized that her bag was not there she poked the person sitting on the outermost seat to ask where is the bag and “why” it’s not there, loudly and visibly annoyed. So rude. For the record, the bag was in the next (front) case but I guess it’s easier to ask someone instead of looking a little further."

Having waited for a while in Mumbai for my suitcase, I finally made it to the counter to file a claim.  It took me 4 hours to get out of the airport trying to file a claim for the missing baggage. The Air France representative  Mr. Akash was nothing but polite, courteous, and a star that worked under pressure. Whilst the process was disorganized and lacked manpower, he was single-handedly managing AF travelers.  I hope they track and manage to deliver my luggage on time. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Palma de Mallorca via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,3,no,3,"  I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden. "

The main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag. The staff in the plane from Chicago to Paris was not very friendly. The staff in the way back from Paris to Chicago was very kind and helpful. Big difference. Lastly, my checked bag didn't make it to Chicago. The staff at Chicago didn't really want to help me. One spent a few moments trying to register a claim, gave up, handed me a card with instructions and walked away. I tried someone else about 15 minutes later, while she was not happy to help, she did complete the claim for me which I appreciated. The bag was delivered to my door, 200 miles from the airport, the next day was was great. I would fly Air France again."

However the Paris to Bangkok segment was excellent on all counts. The service provided by Aurelie Luche was outstanding, professional and ever so efficient and friendly. The food for the 11hour and twenty minute flight was plentiful and tasty. The overall comfort of the seat was not that outstanding but I have to say that what was my first flight with Air France it certainly won't be my last. Well done to the crew, especially to Aurelie."

Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row.

They have a very solid product. Good quality food -two services - and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch. Cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional. Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English, French and Spanish which was a bit much. Also lights a bit bright at other times. Baggage handling and check in fine on both legs. A good solid product from a classic legacy carrier."

Air France in Zanzibar does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even if you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure not to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge. When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! That’s called collecting money under false pretences!  I went online to request my gluten-free meal. I called Air France twice to confirm that the meals had been ordered. However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France forgot to provide a gluten free meal. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error. The moral of the story - if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you! That's after you pay the business class fare of $3200!"

After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart ""as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew"". So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : ""We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards"". The flight was in June, nothing has been reimbursed so far, and not even my request has been answered by October. "

Recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me. Meal selection was limited, forgot to serve me dessert. When asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin. When asking for a napkin, I was given a large table cloth. For breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea. Travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals, you need to feel welcomed and pampered. This was not the case for Air France crew on this flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Dubai,October 2022,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,4.0,5,yes,8,  One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard Wi-Fi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 10/10.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Chicago,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,2,"  I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours. The also didn't have internet on a short leg on our way to Barcelona."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Los Angeles,September 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  We got to CDG airport 3 hours before departure, and we had to run to catch the flight. Long lines, some counters were closed while the ground staff was chatting, no sense of urgency from anyone. The supervisor was less helpful than the others. When we landed at LAX, we didn't find our luggage, and AF personnel had no idea of where it was. It was left in front of the house door the following day without even ringing the bell. We found the bag broken and unrepairable and AF only reimbursed us for 15% of the value for a new bag, with no explanation. "

They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at >than 48 h after the original one. After spending a lot of time listening to their music while waiting for someone to pick up the phone in Customer Care, they hung up the phone in the middle of my question without providing useful information. They seemed very bothered by the fact that I could have used some help."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Hamburg via Paris,July 2022,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We (a family of 4) made a trip to Hamburg in early July and had a stop in Paris. Our first flight had a 2 1/2 hour delay so we couldn’t catch our connection flight. In Paris we spend over 2 hours to find someone feeling responsible for getting us on a new flight. On one of the biggest International Airports in Europe! After a delay of 6 hours we finally arrived in Hamburg, where we recognized that all our 5 Baggage pieces went missing. We immediately made an AHL Report and headed to our Vacation home without any clothes. We made necessity purchases over the 17 day vacation because our baggage still was nowhere to be found. I made a Claim on the Air France Website for those necessity purchases on day 14 of the vacation. After 21 days I made a claim for lost baggage because the baggage still hasn’t arrived. After 28 days 3 of 5 baggages arrived at our home. The remaining 2 haven’t arrived now for over 3 months. The customer Support took forever to just answer and asking simple questions about data that already has been send over and hasn’t paid any compensation yet. They write mails in which they said you have been on a totally wrong flight on a wrong date. For example they wrote we have been on a flight from Paris to Havana on October 11. Somehow they even closed the claim for the missing baggage although 2 pieces are still missing and on the date of the claim 3 pieces have been already missing for over 21 days. Their Website states that after 21 days you’re baggage is supposed to be lost and you are qualified for a compensation.  Never again Air France, worst experience ever."

When I was already seating while the plane was about to leave, the flight attendant came to ask if I still wanted to move to premium economy and pay with my miles. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the extra space on this long night flight. The premium economy seat was comfortable and the service friendly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Montpellier,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,2," An unreliable company, with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements, culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm (see picture)! We finally left with 2h delay (for a 1h flight). No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. In-flight ""business"" meal consisted of nuts, one cookie, and a drink. I don't see the difference with ""economy"". Finally arrived starved, late, having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class, all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Vancouver,September 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France, first Toronto to Paris, after being bumped by WestJet, and taking a flight a few hours later, which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver, with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary, no request was too much, and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I don’t write a lot of reviews, and I usually travel Star Alliance, but for Air France, I’ll gladly make exceptions going forward! I will see Air France in business again in April, to Paris and Lisbon, I cant wait! "

Seat space is very comfortable for economy, 81 cm much more than others offer. Good entertaining and nice crew. Free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack. Only the snack was bad and only dry bread. Delay one hour but arrived on time. Would fly Air France again."

I had a bad experience, on my flight from New York to Paris. Firstly everything was so uncoordinated, the flight got delayed, even the staff from the plane wasn’t in yet even though the boarding would be in 5 minutes. While we was flying there were many inconveniences. First the AC was so cold that I froze the whole time, secondly we flew at night (0:30) and people wanted to sleep but the lights from the airplane were fully on. It was a longer flight but we didn’t receive much to eat and when they came by with water, tea, coffee they didn’t asked me, just a few passengers."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Dubai via Paris,September 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow."

I had to buy a new ticket and it took them over 2 months to refund the previous one. Aircrafts were fine, service was standard for long haul. 3 pieces of luggage delayed for 75 days, no information from their customer service, hard to reach and rude. Worst experience with an airline, they'll never see me again."

CDG could be a small downside for a few people but I've always loved it, even though everything might take a few more minutes, I have always like it because it's beautiful!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Paris via Budapest,April 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The airline sold me a ticket, changing in Paris, but left nowhere near enough time to get through security and run across the airport. It was pretty humiliating, and the staff were incredibly rude. When I complained about it, the customer service lady threatened to cancel my return ticket and actually dismissed me with a 'dusting off her hands' motion. They have completely ignored my request for a refund (it left me £233 out of pocket and with a ruined trip. It took all day just to get home)."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to New York via Paris CDG,January 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My original flight had mechanical problems while in flight, so we diverted to Milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of New York-JFK. It was an awful ordeal. I submitted a delay compensation request back in January, and they finally approved it in September (more than 8 months to process!), but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation. I supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers. They have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point, and now after eight months of waiting, they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount. All I'm asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the European Union. Nothing more, nothing less. "

The mini croissant served on the E190 was tasty. As for the food on the A350, it was satisfying enough but was not up to my expectations. Flight attendants were smiling."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Paris via Bangaluru,September 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,7," Excellent service at Bengaluru. Due to the short time in b/w transfers one bag did not arrive. However Air France had already sent a list of missing baggage and they informed us whilst we were at the luggage carousel, this saving us time. They tracked where our baggage was and sent it on the next flight. It arrived safely. Very helpful staff at Bengaluru who helped us when we were tired and stressed. Thank you Air France! Re food though it's a different review as the quality was poor, food passed off as Indian, really wasn't food any Indian would eat!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Conakry to London Heathrow via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,2," Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa. Terrible airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,First Class,Montréal to Paris,September 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,9," Excellent flight from Paris to Montréal, I wouldn't have recommended Air France 6 or 7 years ago, but this airline is really improving. The cabin crew was pleasing and careful, the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class. The only negative point is that Paris CDG is really disorganized, it is probably one of the worst airports I've had experienced with Amsterdam AMS in Europe. I really hope that it will improve within the next years."
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Zurich,August 2022,2.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight from Zurich to Paris was an hour late.  My return flight experience was worse: I paid for a Siège Plus (11D) with extra legroom. However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag. Between AF and the useless local transporter, I have wasted two days. Is this how AF treats its passengers? Is a Flying Blue Gold member impressed by this experience? I am very frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism from start to finish. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bangalore via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day. You saved us and we are truly grateful. We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Trondheim to London via Amsterdam,April 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Punta Cana via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to say that the airline and cabin crew were absolutely brilliant. They were very attentive and in hand if we needed them. The inflight food was delicious and tasty, not bland like other airlines. We pre-paid for our seats and we’re very pleased with the extra leg room outbound and the Solo seats coming home. I would like to thank all the staff from check in until when we landed. So professional and quick so the queues were small and manageable. Air France made our holiday more amazing by delivering such a wonderful experience. Thank You."

I have travelled from OTP to JFK via CDG and return in business class. A great experience from the lounge, food, beverages to the comfort of the seat. On the return segment JFK -CDG I was upgraded in La Premiere due to my Platinum Ultimate status. The onboard service was state of the art. The champagne the best I have ever tasted. The FAs and the pursers attitude and service flow less. Looking forward to my next trip with AF."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Prague,August 2022,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage. They weigh both bags and if both bags are even 1KG over their 12 KG weight limit they make you walk back to the Air France check-in area to spend 110 euros and 25 minutes to check one bag (not both bags even though they were both weighed together). This would make sense if the luggage was oversized and didn’t fit in the overhead bins but our small luggage was overweight was because we travel with large books. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Beirut via Manchester / Paris,July 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight for an Air France / Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to Beirut. Once I landed in Beirut airport I notice I'm missing one checked bag so I reached out to the missing luggage office and file claim. 2 days later I got update by email that my bag was found, and it will be forwarded to Beirut. I contacted airport for my bag, and they said my bag did not arrive. 2 days later suddenly the claim I filed in the airport was closed and when I contacted customer service, they didn't know how the claim was closed or who closed it. I filed online claim again, since then I have been calling customer service every day about my luggage with no updates. Nobody could explain how my first claim was closed and keep saying no update on my luggage. I filed claim for necessary purchase but I didn't get any reimbursement, then after 21 days filed claim for lost luggage. I started calling air France every day, I got to speak with supervisor who made clear your bag was lost and there is no way for passenger to talk to claim department unless they call you. I asked how long it takes to get my reimbursement, he said, we have long queue and this might take several months. So they lost my bag with promise they will reimburse me when they decide to do with no timeframe. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris CDG,July 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,4,yes,6,"  We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change. Still, I live in hope that Air France ups its game on the service front."

I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner. Shame on Air France. I've never encountered such incompetence."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,August 2022,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We just had a return flight scheduled via Air France on August 1st. We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags. We are told to return in the morning to pick up our other 2 large checked bags that had been pulled from the plane. We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address. Unbelievable service from Air France. No apologies from anyone or care for the extraordinary mess of lines! One bag has been found but the other is untraceable."

Lounge welcome none, food not eatable, Champagne from a cheap brand. These are the only bad news from 2 flights that went smoothly, with excellent on-board service. 16 years old 777, retrofitted, but showing signals of usage. Small (14 seats) business class cabin, therefore very quiet. Connecting in CDG was made easy, with separate immigration for connecting passengers. Lounge in CDG was packed at 6:00 AM ! As usual MRS baggage delivery at MRS is a shame, with no respect for priority bags. Not AF fault; just bad service form third party services."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Paris ,August 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1," Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir. Avoid Air France's archaic customer service system at all costs."
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Rome to Lisbon Via Paris,June 2022,,,,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  Booked a business class flight from Rome to Lisbon Via Paris, completed online check-in, submitted the requested COVID Certificate, and received the Ready to Fly email from Air France, meaning everything I submitted was good to go. Arrived at the departing Airport only to be told that my seat was cancelled, my allocated seat was sold to another passenger, and it was now a sold-out flight. It's been a fight to get my refund. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Paris to Düsseldorf,June 2022,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached. All in all very disappointing."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris,June 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight was canceled on June 17, 2022. It was supposed to depart at 11:55 pm and 30 minutes Before we were supposed to take off they canceled it and told us they are going to give us a hotel to stay in until they get us a new flight, but 4 hours waiting in the airport until they got us a hotel in Manhattan witch is an hour away from the airport. After that they told us to pay for everything we need and save a copy of the receipt and send it to the airline for a refund. I ended up paying around 300 dollars and I still haven’t gotten the money back and it’s been almost 2 months!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Punta Cana via Paris,July 2022,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  This airline have 2 people working at the check in counter where you get there early and spend more than 2 hours waiting on a line even tho they know your flight is about to leave and you need to pass through security. Also they are losing luggage, and if they find one of them was open (even when you put a lock on it) with a lot of missing items. They did not answer the claims made."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to New York ,July 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I make several international trips a year. This trips' flights with Air France were clearly the worst. We were only on this AF flight with our Delta reservations because of code sharing. Not only were the flight attendants condescending, food inedible and the ground service bizarre,  to add insult to injury, they lost our luggage and cannot locate it. AF's service desk is impossible to get on the phone. I have been trying for a day and a half since we returned to ask about the status of my missing luggage. We called Delta and after a wait of over an hour were told we should have called AF. Finally after a wait of over 2 hours we got a person to speak at AF -- the person manning the phones said they live in a status of perpetual wonderment as to where the luggage was and had certainly no idea where mine was. Frustration, upset, anger, disappointment. I will never fly Air France again. If you have an option, take another airline unless you can pack all your clothes in a carry on. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington, DC to Athens via Paris",June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1," We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you. We were not the only people who spent the night at the airport, there were many families with kids who slept on the floor. Absolutely horrible the way they speak to you and also condescending."

The staff was really friendly and helpful, I had a problem with my entertainment device and they quickly fixed it for me. The food was good and the service was perfect, it was possible to ask for drinks or snacks for free which is a big plus. The ambient lights made the flight more enjoyable and the plane was beautiful. I had no problem to retrieve my luggage or to board my flight. I'll definitely fly with Air France again, thank you !"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320/A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Marseille to Montreal via paris,July 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5,yes,9,"  Air France ground staff in Marseille were helpful as they anticipate our flight to CDG, in order to be sure that we would catch our transatlantic flight. However boarding at Marseille was one of the most messy I have ever seen, due to the lack of instructions of staff. Direct channel from Terminal 2F to Terminal 2E (K), with dedicated immigration and no security check was of great relief. Splendid. Catering at lounge was excellent. Boarding of flight to YUL was also a torture, as we had to wait under the sun (during the heat wave) on a ramp during more than 20 minutes. On the other hand service, food and comfort on AF A350 Business class were exceptional, showing a brutal improvement. Air France could have deserved a 10, if they had learned to board with SQ staff."

✅ Trip Verified ,A320/A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Lisbon via Paris,June 2022,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3.0,5,yes,7,"  Online check-in and bag drop at Heathrow were straightforward, but the boarding procedure was cumbersome due to an apparent shortage of people at the gate (only 1 for most of the time). A gate between the queue to enter the departure lounge and the lounge itself was left open and one passenger managed to wander through, by-passing the gate agent. Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks). Probably because of the slow boarding process at Heathrow our first leg to CDG operated 25 minutes late, resulting in us having to sprint up and down staircases at CDG to catch our onward flight to Lisbon. Our baggage made it too -- phew! All in all this was a pleasant experience, especially onboard."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Chennai via Paris,June 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,no,3,  One of the worst baggage service I ever seen. I travelled on end of June and still not received my missing baggage. 10 days back Got a mail saying your baggage was found and it’s on your way but after I haven’t received any information from the airline. Very disappointed with the service. Now I have to travel back to my place without my bag.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to New York via Paris CDG,July 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They have no process in place to smoothly inform people how to declare missing baggage and how to schedule a delivery. I've called the help line over 12 times and have been on hold for upwards of 45 minutes before the line hanging up on me. None of the support options seem to work and I've done my best to be patient, but I would really like an update. On the flight, we were given our meals and for an hour and a half, they let our trays sit there. They didn't pick up the trays for so long that people were helping each other out by holding their trash so they could move about the cabin. The flight attendants were nice, even if not very prompt. They seemed as upset about the situation as we were. I'm still on hold (day 2 trying to speak to someone) as I write this review. "

Air France staff was courteous, attentive and polite. The food was better than I could have imagined, we were served both dinner and breakfast. We flew on the Boeing 777-300ER first row in business class (First Class for this particular plane), the plane was a newer version, has ample leg room with an angled flat bed for comfortable seating. The aircraft was clean and everything in my seating area was in working order. My next trip back to Senegal will be with Air France!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Naples to Paris CDG via New York JFK,July 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Do not use Air France if you have another option! We were scheduled to leave Italy at 6.10 am on July 12, to catch a connecting flight in Paris to JFK. The night before they changed our flight to 7.45 am so we would miss our connecting flight. Instead of scheduling the next available flight from Paris to JFK, they changed our connecting flight multiple times and in the end, we had a 14 hour delay in the airport. No one communicated the reason for this long delay, we can only assume that they gave our seats away to the passengers that had already been stuck in the airport for 24-48 hours for a plane to JFK. The only compensation Air France offered us was a $31 food voucher for five passengers to hold us over for a fourteen hour delay. It is apparent that this airline is not at all prepared to accommodate the influx of passengers flying their airline and definitely does not respect their passengers time. We will never fly this airline again!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lyon to Venice via Paris,July 2022,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The tickets for our flight were bought online, yet at check-in, we were told the flight was full and that we had to board a different flight with a stop over at Amsterdam. We were originally going from Lyon to Venice. The new route costed us a delay of more than 2 hours. Each flight we boarded, or checked-in for, we were told they did not have a seat for us until everyone else had boarded. It felt like we had bought last-minute budget tickets and treated less than everybody else. Yet we had spent a large amount to travel to Venice. The entire journey we were still grateful we could fly and hopeful we could get to our destination. It was stressful to say the least. This has been a bad experience and I don't recommend Air France."

The flight was delayed for two hours and when we arrive, we had to wait for another hour to find that there was no luggage. It is now the 14/07/2022 and I still don't have my luggage! Last Saturday, I received a message saying the luggage was found. But I have not received the luggage yet. Therefore, and considering the very long time I have been without luggage and without actually managing to talk, exchange messages or even smoke signs with Air France, I found the company unreliable with a terrible customer service.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Newcastle via Paris,July 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,1,"  What a shambles and I will never fly with Air France again. This flight was 1.5 hours late, which seems normal for that flight.  AF had tried to throw me off my connecting flight and put me on one for the next day but the check-in girl at BKK managed to reverse it and I made the flight. I asked on exit how far away my next gate was but they didn’t have a clue. A 2-3-2 business class is decades out of date and the cabin crew were men who did their job in a minimalist manner but there was no friendliness or engagement with the passengers, downright miserable. The food felt very overly reheated. There looks like a lot of pages of movies but a lot of it was many copies of the same film, no idea what that was about as you choose your language when you click on play. They get round their terrible performance by using that awful and insulting catch-all phrase, “For operational reasons”. When we landed at CDG there was another plane still at our gate."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Birmingham ,June 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  My trip is over and I have still not received my bag. Horrible service. They do not answer phone calls or respond to emails. They literally left me high and dry. The fact that my holiday is over and still no correspondence from this retched airline I feel is reason enough not to fly with them. Honestly ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing time.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Paris,June 2022,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The check in lines were long and there were not enough staff. The flight delayed for over an hour, more than 5 baggage were lost in a flight which causing a long queue on the luggage center. However, there were only two staff there. The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing. So basically if you take Air France and the baggage is lost during the flight, you will not be able to do anything and no one from Air France can help you."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Berlin,July 2022,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,3,no,5,"  I flew with Air France on flight AF1424 on 3rd July 2022 from Paris to Berlin. I knew there were cases of large queues for luggage check-ins and anticipating this, I left for the airport 4 hrs earlier and arrived 3.5hrs earlier than my flight time. And as expected, the line was huge. Despite the fact that they had automatic machines where you could check in your luggage, those machines opened late and 3-5 members of Air France were operating those counters. When the machines started running, people did not know how to use them. For example, if your bag were overweight by a certain threshold, the machine would get stuck. Thus, requiring human interference (or maybe people just didn’t know) to make it start working again. Secondly, the machine did not mention that you need to check in your hand luggage also. So, people had to come back from security. There was also a long line of people printing luggage tags after getting in line. Thus coming back and forth into the queues and stalling the people behind them. There were people just getting in line without waiting for their turn.  Some of the cabin crew were gloomy."

All we were told was to go to gate K57 and arrangements would be made. Only arrangement was made for business class passengers as if rest were travelling for free. Air France lounges denied entry even after many were ready to pay charges from pocket. It is 12.03 at night and no one from Air France has come."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Firenze to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Thank you Air France for providing exceptional customer service. I read these reviews and they mostly appear to be only a bad experience. But my experience had the potential to be bad, but you handled it exceedingly well. My flight from Firenze to CDG was going to arrive late and I would miss my connection. In flight, the attendant told me I was going to miss the connection, my new flight was already booked for the next day, and that I would be provided a hotel and meals. When I arrived every word of this was true. I stayed in a very nice airport hotel (Golden Lotus) that provided exceptional buffet style food, I used the hotel shuttle, and you also gave me a meal voucher as well for the airport. I was concerned leaving my luggage overnight in the airport, but it arrived safely in LAX the following day. You could not have made this any easier, and I was really only delayed about 12 hours in total. I've flown with you 3 times now to Italy and you will always be my first choice. Yes, occasionally I may experience an inconvenience, but I will always remember how you handled this perfectly. My only suggestion for the foreign traveler would be maybe to have a printed map (handed to them by the flight attendant) with the details where the Air France Customer Service kiosk is located, and also where the hotel shuttles are located. It's such a huge airport and this took me a little time to navigate."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Paris via Tunis,June 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3," I take a yearly trip to Tunisia, and I've flown with a lot of airlines over the years. I have encountered delays and issues with flight logistics but it was always handled smoothly and professionally by the airline. This time I tried Air France because they offered a trip without much waiting time before the corresponding flight, and what a huge mistake I made. First trip from Montreal to Paris was cancelled out of nowhere. No explanation was given and the only heads up I got was an email that was filtered as a spam since they sent it through a shady email. They rescheduled that flight for another one that got delayed for 2 hours. No heads up this time and of course no explanation. The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter). Needless to say that this is my first and last trip with AF. I really recommend anybody flying long distance to avoid AF at all costs, they do not seem to be able to handle the logistics of a corresponding trip."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Nice,June 2022,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety. "

Of course the airline lost the luggage and now in Bordeaux they sent an email that one cannot respond to for sending the luggage to our hotel but they gave the wrong number to call back and cannot get in touch to coordinate the lost bag reaching our hotel. 2 days after landing in Bordeaux still no bag. Stay away from this airline, I will never book with them again."

The flat bed was more like a recliner seat and my food was not up to the quality. Flight back from Paris to LAX took off late and I was very hungry. Flight attendant gave me menu, I chose salmon, she mentioned that is not available since it has been taken. No issues but when I paid a premium to travel business, should not I expect better. Given vegetarian which was very salty."

The wonderful ladies at the Air France counter at the airport were, through determined shuffling, able to accommodate all of us on the next flight to Vancouver. There was otherwise a real possibility that some of would have had to stay overnight. Kudos to the attentiveness of the Air France agents!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Rome via Paris,May 2022,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Osaka to Rome via Paris. I chose to travel with Air France  because it was the ""cheapest"" and the ""shortest"" route. I would recommend flying with them as the trip was ok, but there are things to improve! Duration of the first flight is 15 hours. Although I was worried for this very long trip, time passed quickly aboard. I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !! A particular appreciation for a female flight attendant on the flight from Osaka, and a male flight attendant on the flight to Rome. Both very kind and helpful."

We were behind schedule when we landed at CDG with only a small chance of making our connecting flight that day. My wife made it to the correct gate and was able to board while I ended up at the wrong gate. I would like to offer a huge thank you to Captain Emmanuel Rollier who insisted the plane would not leave until I arrived at the plane. The rest of the crew were equally supportive and helped create a positive ending to what had been a very stressful day. Thanks again to Captain and crew. 
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Vancouver,June 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1,  Horrible service and food. Very dirty bathrooms. The cushions or pillows had stains all over. Old airplane. They asked if I wanted chicken or pasta. I said pasta. They said we don’t have it and left. It’s a disgusting airline.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to mention the name of Mr Sunil Lohat who did a great job by helping us and making our journey very comfortable. I think without the help of this gentleman, it wouldn't have been possible for us to board the flight. Mr Sunil helped us till the last moment and ensured that we board the flight. He did everything which a customer needs during any technical hitches which is not known to the passenger. Hats off to such a committed and helping person.  He really made our day in the time of crisis and now I have landed Toronto without any hassles. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A220-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris CDG to Berlin,April 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,9," One way flight from Paris CDG to Berlin BER in April. A smooth and hassle-free flight on a brand new plane. The Airbus A220 is comfortable and offers free WIFI for Whatsapp and other messengers. Air France gives you a free small sandwich and a drink of your choice, alcoholic beverages included. Airport services were also fine. Check-in and security check in CDG took only a few minutes and in Berlin I got my luggage within 5 minutes. I think currently AF is the best airline in Europe."
Not Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Sint Maarten,June 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Was pleasantly surprised with Air France as I was expecting the worst experience. The aircraft felt up to date, entertainment system worked fine and had plenty of choices. Crew were very friendly and personally greeted us and asked if we needed anything. The meal services were great, the main meal was the best one I had in economy for quite sometime as mostly they are inedible but this was good, chicken with mushrooms and polenta, a small salad with Camargue rice and a delicious small pastry for dessert, coffee and wine. The meal service before landing was presented in a small gift bag and contents were tasty, a nice touch I thought."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington  to Florence via Paris CDG,June 2022,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  Delayed on initial flight for both our departure and return trips. This caused us to miss our connection. Each time Air France made it incredibly difficult to rebook. We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent. I will never take any airline that connects in CDG and will absolutely avoid Air France at all costs. The flight attendants were great and the only positive interactions we had were with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Paris via Heathrow,June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  I flew Air France return for my trip to the UK. Seats were small, service apathetic, CDG was a huge disappointment. On the way back they lost my suitcase, still MIA and no feedback from the airline. You have to hold on the phone for ages, get a surly customer service person or your call dropped."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Seoul via Amsterdam,April 2022,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,2,no,1,"  Air France / KLM lure you with the free change ticket. Unluckily, it's an hoax. To begin with, no matter what's the actual price difference, I was asked to pay an amount of money that equal/ed the price of the full ticket at minimum. Eventually, I decided to accept it and was going to pay to change the ticket for my return flight. while I was shown several options, only a tiny percentage were available to book, maybe 30%. All the rest gave a system error and a message to call their hotline, which cost me a lot of wasted time. When I called the hotline, they told the flight was available, but cost more than the full price of a one way ticket. The actual flight was OK, but this rebooking experience was so disappointing and time consuming that I cannot help but to give KLM a 0."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London Heathrow via Paris,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Awful customer service, who are clearly trained to keep you in a loop of confusion, in hope that you give up on whatever it is you need help with. Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong. It amazes me that big companies like Air France can get away with having no customer service whatsoever."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Toronto,June 2022,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,3,no,1," Paris to Toronto. I spent the last 3 weeks travelling to different parts of Europe. I have taken 5 flights total, including my flight home with Air France. I am extremely disappointed with the airport and baggage situation. I arrived at the airport and had my luggage that was not overweight and my carry on luggage that was 12kg as required and purse. I checked my luggage in and proceeded to the security. When arriving at security they weighed my carry on and indicated I had to add my purse on top. Due to my purse and carry on luggage being 14kg together. They stated my carry on or purse needed to be paid for and put through baggage or I needed to remove items and throw them out. I had to go all the way back and pay for my carry on luggage that did not have a lock and had valuable items in it to be put through with baggage. I spent 85 euros that I had no intention in spending as I ensured to make my luggage and carry on for the weight requirements. I’m extremely disappointed that this occurred and felt it was very uncalled for as this has been the only airline who requires a shoulder purse to be weighted."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Geneva to Buenos Aires via Paris ,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  First leg GVA-CDG was delayed due to circumstances outside of AF's control, I completely understand. But I still managed to get to the gate to my CDG-EZE flight with just 5-10 minutes delay. we arrived to find the plane still at the gate but boarding closed. So AF's team had to deny boarding to the 20+ passengers that arrived just a few minutes late. We were then sent to the AF counter AND were assigned a hotel some 40 minutes drive from the airport (this was almost midnight by then). We were told a shuttle would take us to the hotel. We come out to an empty parking lot, no shuttle in sight. In the end we had to google the hotel's name and pay for a uber to take us there. We arrive to the hotel (which was partially under construction) at around 1AM, and the hotel manager has no idea if and when AF will send a shuttle to bring me back to the airport. AF set me in an Iberia flight via Madrid, so I had to be back at the airport at 5.30AM.  I make it back to the airport, to find out my luggage was not transferred by AF to Iberia, so I would have to leave without it. I spent the next week in Argentina without my luggage, unsuccessfully trying to get information from AF and/or Iberia."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Paris,May 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,5,yes,8,"  Business class cabin is not the newest one in airline industry but still very good. The window seat is spacious with very much room for ones feet (perfect in flat bed mode) and very comfy. I slept very well. Privacy could be a little bit better but will be improved with the new suite type of seats for B777. IFE: Screen size and selection are good, picture quality is not on par with modern systems - but of course you can not expect this. The crew has been very friendly and helpful, food was plenty and delicious with a great starter (picture) and one of the best steaks I ever had on board (sorry, forgot to take a picture). Check in in SFO was very slow (almost 40 minutes for 12 people) but otherwise no complaints. Lounge was small and crowded, but food, beverages and WIFI were very good. I really liked the whole experience and appreciated the attentive and cordial service on board. Well done, Air France. I am looking forward to fly with you again long haul."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Paris, France to Bangalore, India",May 2022,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2,no,3,  Air France has been ok for sometime but on this trip their system would not let me enter/select special meals. They had the entire flight delayed by 45 minutes since their ‘business class’ passenger was delayed. As if the regular passengers time is not worthy.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200 / 777-300,Business,Business Class,Conakry to Washington via Paris,December 2021,4.0,4.0,,,,1.0,3,no,7,"  Conakry to Washington via Paris. Six months now and no resolution to a delayed baggage claim for purchasing incidentals totaling about $350. I will travel back to W. Africa next month in business class and informed Air France Customer Service (my fifth call to them get this resolved) that if my claim is not processed in the next two weeks that I will book with Brussels Airlines, which serves the same route. Shameful and inexcusable on the part of Air France."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris,May 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,1," Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris. Very disrespectful to their customers. Initially, the return flight was booked for a Saturday evening. But 2 months in advance Air France cancelled the flight. Since there was only one flight a day, we had to reschedule for the Sunday flight. Air France did not want to book a hotel or pay (part of the extra hotel costs). On check-in at Abuja, check-in was denied, because the flight was scheduled for the day before (Saturday), doh. Even though I was carrying the ticket with the new date, the booking confirmation and the e-mail about the cancellation, they refused boarding. At long last, the ticket office printed a new ticket for Sunday, and informed us, that they would not charge us at this time. On arrival in Paris, there was a technical problem with the bridge, which delayed the flight by half an hour. Air France staff refused to assist to help us catch the connecting flight. As a result, we missed the flight. At the transfer counter, the helpful staff informed us of this fact, as if we were to blame for it. On arrival in Amsterdam, of course, our bags were missing. We claimed the missing bags immediately. It took Air France a full week, to deliver the bags (from Paris to Amsterdam). When they eventually delivered the bags, one was damaged (broken handle). We also claimed the damage on the handle immediately. So far it has been 3 weeks, and Air France is not responding to any requests, nor handling our damage claim. I would row a boat to Nigeria than fly with an airline that is so disinterested in their customers. Never again."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Havana,May 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2,no,3,"  Very poor meals for a 10hour flight (Paris CDG to Havana). They provided one meal ~1.5 hours after the take off and then we were starving as the last one was ~1.5 before landing. Both were unsatisfactory for such a long flight, equal to those offered in 3 hour flights of other airlines such Aegean. Also one of the flight attendants woke us up (4 people) at 4.30am while everyone was sleeping because she wanted to find her bag. She first opened the cases above our seats and after she realized that her bag was not there she poked the person sitting on the outermost seat to ask where is the bag and “why” it’s not there, loudly and visibly annoyed. So rude. For the record, the bag was in the next (front) case but I guess it’s easier to ask someone instead of looking a little further."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Mumbai via Paris,April 2022,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2,no,2,"  Delayed take-off by two hours from YYZ. Having waited for a while in Mumbai for my suitcase, I finally made it to the counter to file a claim.  It took me 4 hours to get out of the airport trying to file a claim for the missing baggage. The Air France representative  Mr. Akash was nothing but polite, courteous, and a star that worked under pressure. Whilst the process was disorganized and lacked manpower, he was single-handedly managing AF travelers.  I hope they track and manage to deliver my luggage on time. "
