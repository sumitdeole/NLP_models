✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Palma de Mallorca via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,3,no,3,"  I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden. "
Not Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Paris,November 2022,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4,yes,7,"  The plane was nice. IFE was pretty good. The main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag. The staff in the plane from Chicago to Paris was not very friendly. The staff in the way back from Paris to Chicago was very kind and helpful. Big difference. Lastly, my checked bag didn't make it to Chicago. The staff at Chicago didn't really want to help me. One spent a few moments trying to register a claim, gave up, handed me a card with instructions and walked away. I tried someone else about 15 minutes later, while she was not happy to help, she did complete the claim for me which I appreciated. The bag was delivered to my door, 200 miles from the airport, the next day was was great. I would fly Air France again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manchester to Bangkok via Paris ,November 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  The Manchester to Paris segment was very average with a very poor seat pitch but for a 1hr 20 min flight I could grin and bear it. However the Paris to Bangkok segment was excellent on all counts. The service provided by Aurelie Luche was outstanding, professional and ever so efficient and friendly. The food for the 11hour and twenty minute flight was plentiful and tasty. The overall comfort of the seat was not that outstanding but I have to say that what was my first flight with Air France it certainly won't be my last. Well done to the crew, especially to Aurelie."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200ER,Business,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,November 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Glitch with agent put me in regular window seat, instead of paid exit row. Although plane was near capacity, flight attendant went to great lengths to find me an aisle seat and overhead space for camera equipment. Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row. The pair retails for $250! I thanked her profusely, and offered to send her a photo gift. I hope she replies. This flight crew was very professional, positive and engaging."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mexico City to Paris,November 2022,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,8,"  Wonderful flight. Extremely professional crew and delicious food. I didn't love the seat and found it a bit narrow compared to others, but didn't detract from the experience. Would recommend."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Paris CDG,November 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8," A good return trip to PUJ in the Caribbean with AF from CDG. They have a very solid product. Good quality food -two services - and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch. Cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional. Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English, French and Spanish which was a bit much. Also lights a bit bright at other times. Baggage handling and check in fine on both legs. A good solid product from a classic legacy carrier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Miami to Zanzibar via Paris,August 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,2,"  Air France business class lounge in Zanzibar is non-existent! Air France in Zanzibar does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even if you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure not to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge. When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! That’s called collecting money under false pretences!  I went online to request my gluten-free meal. I called Air France twice to confirm that the meals had been ordered. However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France forgot to provide a gluten free meal. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error. The moral of the story - if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you! That's after you pay the business class fare of $3200!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 190,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Düsseldorf to Paris CDG,October 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,9, Nice short trip on time. We were even served a sandwich and drink on a 45 min flight. Outstanding: due to train delay I arrived at airport just 40 min before flight. Pulled me through first and even baggage arrived.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris Orly to Pointe-à-Pitre,May 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our flight in June 2022 was already late, and once in the plane and already moving on the ground in order to take-off, the crew detected a fuel leak,o we had to ""pass by technical control"", while remaining in the plane. After having waited 1 hour in the aircraft with an obviously upset crew, they finally told us that this aircraft could not fly and that we have to wait in the airport for another aircraft to continue our journey. After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart ""as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew"". So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : ""We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards"". The flight was in June, nothing has been reimbursed so far, and not even my request has been answered by October. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Mauritius to Paris,October 2022,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2,no,6,"  Air France Business Class Mauritius to Paris Boeing 777. Recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me. Meal selection was limited, forgot to serve me dessert. When asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin. When asking for a napkin, I was given a large table cloth. For breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea. Travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals, you need to feel welcomed and pampered. This was not the case for Air France crew on this flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Dubai,October 2022,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,4.0,5,yes,8,  One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard Wi-Fi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 10/10.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Chicago,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,2,"  I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours. The also didn't have internet on a short leg on our way to Barcelona."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Los Angeles,September 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  We got to CDG airport 3 hours before departure, and we had to run to catch the flight. Long lines, some counters were closed while the ground staff was chatting, no sense of urgency from anyone. The supervisor was less helpful than the others. When we landed at LAX, we didn't find our luggage, and AF personnel had no idea of where it was. It was left in front of the house door the following day without even ringing the bell. We found the bag broken and unrepairable and AF only reimbursed us for 15% of the value for a new bag, with no explanation. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Bucharest to Paris,October 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They have cancelled the flight 15 minutes before departure. They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at >than 48 h after the original one. After spending a lot of time listening to their music while waiting for someone to pick up the phone in Customer Care, they hung up the phone in the middle of my question without providing useful information. They seemed very bothered by the fact that I could have used some help."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Hamburg via Paris,July 2022,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We (a family of 4) made a trip to Hamburg in early July and had a stop in Paris. Our first flight had a 2 1/2 hour delay so we couldn’t catch our connection flight. In Paris we spend over 2 hours to find someone feeling responsible for getting us on a new flight. On one of the biggest International Airports in Europe! After a delay of 6 hours we finally arrived in Hamburg, where we recognized that all our 5 Baggage pieces went missing. We immediately made an AHL Report and headed to our Vacation home without any clothes. We made necessity purchases over the 17 day vacation because our baggage still was nowhere to be found. I made a Claim on the Air France Website for those necessity purchases on day 14 of the vacation. After 21 days I made a claim for lost baggage because the baggage still hasn’t arrived. After 28 days 3 of 5 baggages arrived at our home. The remaining 2 haven’t arrived now for over 3 months. The customer Support took forever to just answer and asking simple questions about data that already has been send over and hasn’t paid any compensation yet. They write mails in which they said you have been on a totally wrong flight on a wrong date. For example they wrote we have been on a flight from Paris to Havana on October 11. Somehow they even closed the claim for the missing baggage although 2 pieces are still missing and on the date of the claim 3 pieces have been already missing for over 21 days. Their Website states that after 21 days you’re baggage is supposed to be lost and you are qualified for a compensation.  Never again Air France, worst experience ever."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Business,Premium Economy,Bogota to Helsinki via Paris,October 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  I had tried to upgrade from economy to premium economy online, but there was no availability. When I was already seating while the plane was about to leave, the flight attendant came to ask if I still wanted to move to premium economy and pay with my miles. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the extra space on this long night flight. The premium economy seat was comfortable and the service friendly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Montpellier,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,2," An unreliable company, with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements, culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm (see picture)! We finally left with 2h delay (for a 1h flight). No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. In-flight ""business"" meal consisted of nuts, one cookie, and a drink. I don't see the difference with ""economy"". Finally arrived starved, late, having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class, all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Vancouver,September 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France, first Toronto to Paris, after being bumped by WestJet, and taking a flight a few hours later, which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver, with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary, no request was too much, and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I don’t write a lot of reviews, and I usually travel Star Alliance, but for Air France, I’ll gladly make exceptions going forward! I will see Air France in business again in April, to Paris and Lisbon, I cant wait! "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New U=York to Paris,October 2022,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  Very Smooth flight. Seat space is very comfortable for economy, 81 cm much more than others offer. Good entertaining and nice crew. Free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack. Only the snack was bad and only dry bread. Delay one hour but arrived on time. Would fly Air France again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Stuttgart via Paris,October 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,2," New York to Stuttgart via Paris. I had a bad experience, on my flight from New York to Paris. Firstly everything was so uncoordinated, the flight got delayed, even the staff from the plane wasn’t in yet even though the boarding would be in 5 minutes. While we was flying there were many inconveniences. First the AC was so cold that I froze the whole time, secondly we flew at night (0:30) and people wanted to sleep but the lights from the airplane were fully on. It was a longer flight but we didn’t receive much to eat and when they came by with water, tea, coffee they didn’t asked me, just a few passengers."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Seattle,September 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,yes,9," We had the best flight attendants. They were lovely. Very attentive to the passengers, very friendly. We were on flight 338 on September 29 leaving Paris to Seattle at 14:15."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Dubai via Paris,September 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hamburg to Punta Cana via Paris CDG,July 2022,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flights cancelled at short notice, no rebooking options, no compensation. I had to buy a new ticket and it took them over 2 months to refund the previous one. Aircrafts were fine, service was standard for long haul. 3 pieces of luggage delayed for 75 days, no information from their customer service, hard to reach and rude. Worst experience with an airline, they'll never see me again."
Not Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Air France has been improving recently even if I already enjoyed flying this Airline,. CDG could be a small downside for a few people but I've always loved it, even though everything might take a few more minutes, I have always like it because it's beautiful!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Paris via Budapest,April 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The airline sold me a ticket, changing in Paris, but left nowhere near enough time to get through security and run across the airport. It was pretty humiliating, and the staff were incredibly rude. When I complained about it, the customer service lady threatened to cancel my return ticket and actually dismissed me with a 'dusting off her hands' motion. They have completely ignored my request for a refund (it left me £233 out of pocket and with a ruined trip. It took all day just to get home)."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to New York via Paris CDG,January 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My original flight had mechanical problems while in flight, so we diverted to Milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of New York-JFK. It was an awful ordeal. I submitted a delay compensation request back in January, and they finally approved it in September (more than 8 months to process!), but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation. I supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers. They have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point, and now after eight months of waiting, they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount. All I'm asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the European Union. Nothing more, nothing less. "
Not Verified ,A350/E190,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Nuremberg via Paris,September 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Overall, a pleasant flight. The mini croissant served on the E190 was tasty. As for the food on the A350, it was satisfying enough but was not up to my expectations. Flight attendants were smiling."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Paris via Bangaluru,September 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,7," Excellent service at Bengaluru. Due to the short time in b/w transfers one bag did not arrive. However Air France had already sent a list of missing baggage and they informed us whilst we were at the luggage carousel, this saving us time. They tracked where our baggage was and sent it on the next flight. It arrived safely. Very helpful staff at Bengaluru who helped us when we were tired and stressed. Thank you Air France! Re food though it's a different review as the quality was poor, food passed off as Indian, really wasn't food any Indian would eat!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Conakry to London Heathrow via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,2," Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa. Terrible airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,First Class,Montréal to Paris,September 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,9," Excellent flight from Paris to Montréal, I wouldn't have recommended Air France 6 or 7 years ago, but this airline is really improving. The cabin crew was pleasing and careful, the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class. The only negative point is that Paris CDG is really disorganized, it is probably one of the worst airports I've had experienced with Amsterdam AMS in Europe. I really hope that it will improve within the next years."
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Zurich,August 2022,2.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight from Zurich to Paris was an hour late.  My return flight experience was worse: I paid for a Siège Plus (11D) with extra legroom. However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag. Between AF and the useless local transporter, I have wasted two days. Is this how AF treats its passengers? Is a Flying Blue Gold member impressed by this experience? I am very frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism from start to finish. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bangalore via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day. You saved us and we are truly grateful. We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Trondheim to London via Amsterdam,April 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Punta Cana via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to say that the airline and cabin crew were absolutely brilliant. They were very attentive and in hand if we needed them. The inflight food was delicious and tasty, not bland like other airlines. We pre-paid for our seats and we’re very pleased with the extra leg room outbound and the Solo seats coming home. I would like to thank all the staff from check in until when we landed. So professional and quick so the queues were small and manageable. Air France made our holiday more amazing by delivering such a wonderful experience. Thank You."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,Bucharest to New York via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Outstanding service. I have travelled from OTP to JFK via CDG and return in business class. A great experience from the lounge, food, beverages to the comfort of the seat. On the return segment JFK -CDG I was upgraded in La Premiere due to my Platinum Ultimate status. The onboard service was state of the art. The champagne the best I have ever tasted. The FAs and the pursers attitude and service flow less. Looking forward to my next trip with AF."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Prague,August 2022,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage. They weigh both bags and if both bags are even 1KG over their 12 KG weight limit they make you walk back to the Air France check-in area to spend 110 euros and 25 minutes to check one bag (not both bags even though they were both weighed together). This would make sense if the luggage was oversized and didn’t fit in the overhead bins but our small luggage was overweight was because we travel with large books. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Beirut via Manchester / Paris,July 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight for an Air France / Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to Beirut. Once I landed in Beirut airport I notice I'm missing one checked bag so I reached out to the missing luggage office and file claim. 2 days later I got update by email that my bag was found, and it will be forwarded to Beirut. I contacted airport for my bag, and they said my bag did not arrive. 2 days later suddenly the claim I filed in the airport was closed and when I contacted customer service, they didn't know how the claim was closed or who closed it. I filed online claim again, since then I have been calling customer service every day about my luggage with no updates. Nobody could explain how my first claim was closed and keep saying no update on my luggage. I filed claim for necessary purchase but I didn't get any reimbursement, then after 21 days filed claim for lost luggage. I started calling air France every day, I got to speak with supervisor who made clear your bag was lost and there is no way for passenger to talk to claim department unless they call you. I asked how long it takes to get my reimbursement, he said, we have long queue and this might take several months. So they lost my bag with promise they will reimburse me when they decide to do with no timeframe. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris CDG,July 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,4,yes,6,"  We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change. Still, I live in hope that Air France ups its game on the service front."

I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner. Shame on Air France. I've never encountered such incompetence."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,August 2022,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We just had a return flight scheduled via Air France on August 1st. We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags. We are told to return in the morning to pick up our other 2 large checked bags that had been pulled from the plane. We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address. Unbelievable service from Air France. No apologies from anyone or care for the extraordinary mess of lines! One bag has been found but the other is untraceable."

Lounge welcome none, food not eatable, Champagne from a cheap brand. These are the only bad news from 2 flights that went smoothly, with excellent on-board service. 16 years old 777, retrofitted, but showing signals of usage. Small (14 seats) business class cabin, therefore very quiet. Connecting in CDG was made easy, with separate immigration for connecting passengers. Lounge in CDG was packed at 6:00 AM ! As usual MRS baggage delivery at MRS is a shame, with no respect for priority bags. Not AF fault; just bad service form third party services."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Paris ,August 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1," Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir. Avoid Air France's archaic customer service system at all costs."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Paris to Düsseldorf,June 2022,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached. All in all very disappointing."

It was supposed to depart at 11:55 pm and 30 minutes Before we were supposed to take off they canceled it and told us they are going to give us a hotel to stay in until they get us a new flight, but 4 hours waiting in the airport until they got us a hotel in Manhattan witch is an hour away from the airport. After that they told us to pay for everything we need and save a copy of the receipt and send it to the airline for a refund.

This trips' flights with Air France were clearly the worst. We were only on this AF flight with our Delta reservations because of code sharing. Not only were the flight attendants condescending, food inedible and the ground service bizarre,  to add insult to injury, they lost our luggage and cannot locate it. AF's service desk is impossible to get on the phone. I have been trying for a day and a half since we returned to ask about the status of my missing luggage. We called Delta and after a wait of over an hour were told we should have called AF. Finally after a wait of over 2 hours we got a person to speak at AF -- the person manning the phones said they live in a status of perpetual wonderment as to where the luggage was and had certainly no idea where mine was. Frustration, upset, anger, disappointment. I will never fly Air France again. If you have an option, take another airline unless you can pack all your clothes in a carry on. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington, DC to Athens via Paris",June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1," We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you. We were not the only people who spent the night at the airport, there were many families with kids who slept on the floor. Absolutely horrible the way they speak to you and also condescending."

However boarding at Marseille was one of the most messy I have ever seen, due to the lack of instructions of staff. Direct channel from Terminal 2F to Terminal 2E (K), with dedicated immigration and no security check was of great relief. Splendid. Catering at lounge was excellent. Boarding of flight to YUL was also a torture, as we had to wait under the sun (during the heat wave) on a ramp during more than 20 minutes. On the other hand service, food and comfort on AF A350 Business class were exceptional, showing a brutal improvement. Air France could have deserved a 10, if they had learned to board with SQ staff."

A gate between the queue to enter the departure lounge and the lounge itself was left open and one passenger managed to wander through, by-passing the gate agent. Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks). Probably because of the slow boarding process at Heathrow our first leg to CDG operated 25 minutes late, resulting in us having to sprint up and down staircases at CDG to catch our onward flight to Lisbon. Our baggage made it too -- phew! All in all this was a pleasant experience, especially onboard."

I've called the help line over 12 times and have been on hold for upwards of 45 minutes before the line hanging up on me. None of the support options seem to work and I've done my best to be patient, but I would really like an update. On the flight, we were given our meals and for an hour and a half, they let our trays sit there. They didn't pick up the trays for so long that people were helping each other out by holding their trash so they could move about the cabin. The flight attendants were nice, even if not very prompt. They seemed as upset about the situation as we were. I'm still on hold (day 2 trying to speak to someone) as I write this review. "

Air France staff was courteous, attentive and polite. The food was better than I could have imagined, we were served both dinner and breakfast. We flew on the Boeing 777-300ER first row in business class (First Class for this particular plane), the plane was a newer version, has ample leg room with an angled flat bed for comfortable seating. The aircraft was clean and everything in my seating area was in working order. My next trip back to Senegal will be with Air France!"

We were scheduled to leave Italy at 6.10 am on July 12, to catch a connecting flight in Paris to JFK. The night before they changed our flight to 7.45 am so we would miss our connecting flight. Instead of scheduling the next available flight from Paris to JFK, they changed our connecting flight multiple times and in the end, we had a 14 hour delay in the airport. No one communicated the reason for this long delay, we can only assume that they gave our seats away to the passengers that had already been stuck in the airport for 24-48 hours for a plane to JFK. The only compensation Air France offered us was a $31 food voucher for five passengers to hold us over for a fourteen hour delay. It is apparent that this airline is not at all prepared to accommodate the influx of passengers flying their airline and definitely does not respect their passengers time. We will never fly this airline again!"

We were originally going from Lyon to Venice. The new route costed us a delay of more than 2 hours. Each flight we boarded, or checked-in for, we were told they did not have a seat for us until everyone else had boarded. It felt like we had bought last-minute budget tickets and treated less than everybody else. Yet we had spent a large amount to travel to Venice. The entire journey we were still grateful we could fly and hopeful we could get to our destination. It was stressful to say the least. This has been a bad experience and I don't recommend Air France."

Last Saturday, I received a message saying the luggage was found. But I have not received the luggage yet.

This flight was 1.5 hours late, which seems normal for that flight.  AF had tried to throw me off my connecting flight and put me on one for the next day but the check-in girl at BKK managed to reverse it and I made the flight. I asked on exit how far away my next gate was but they didn’t have a clue. A 2-3-2 business class is decades out of date and the cabin crew were men who did their job in a minimalist manner but there was no friendliness or engagement with the passengers, downright miserable. The food felt very overly reheated. There looks like a lot of pages of movies but a lot of it was many copies of the same film, no idea what that was about as you choose your language when you click on play. They get round their terrible performance by using that awful and insulting catch-all phrase, “For operational reasons”. When we landed at CDG there was another plane still at our gate."

The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing. So basically if you take Air France and the baggage is lost during the flight, you will not be able to do anything and no one from Air France can help you."

I knew there were cases of large queues for luggage check-ins and anticipating this, I left for the airport 4 hrs earlier and arrived 3.5hrs earlier than my flight time. And as expected, the line was huge. Despite the fact that they had automatic machines where you could check in your luggage, those machines opened late and 3-5 members of Air France were operating those counters. When the machines started running, people did not know how to use them. For example, if your bag were overweight by a certain threshold, the machine would get stuck. Thus, requiring human interference (or maybe people just didn’t know) to make it start working again. Secondly, the machine did not mention that you need to check in your hand luggage also. So, people had to come back from security. There was also a long line of people printing luggage tags after getting in line. Thus coming back and forth into the queues and stalling the people behind them. There were people just getting in line without waiting for their turn.  Some of the cabin crew were gloomy."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Firenze to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Thank you Air France for providing exceptional customer service. I read these reviews and they mostly appear to be only a bad experience. But my experience had the potential to be bad, but you handled it exceedingly well. My flight from Firenze to CDG was going to arrive late and I would miss my connection. In flight, the attendant told me I was going to miss the connection, my new flight was already booked for the next day, and that I would be provided a hotel and meals. When I arrived every word of this was true. I stayed in a very nice airport hotel (Golden Lotus) that provided exceptional buffet style food, I used the hotel shuttle, and you also gave me a meal voucher as well for the airport. I was concerned leaving my luggage overnight in the airport, but it arrived safely in LAX the following day. You could not have made this any easier, and I was really only delayed about 12 hours in total. I've flown with you 3 times now to Italy and you will always be my first choice. Yes, occasionally I may experience an inconvenience, but I will always remember how you handled this perfectly. My only suggestion for the foreign traveler would be maybe to have a printed map (handed to them by the flight attendant) with the details where the Air France Customer Service kiosk is located, and also where the hotel shuttles are located. It's such a huge airport and this took me a little time to navigate."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Paris via Tunis,June 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3," I take a yearly trip to Tunisia, and I've flown with a lot of airlines over the years. I have encountered delays and issues with flight logistics but it was always handled smoothly and professionally by the airline. This time I tried Air France because they offered a trip without much waiting time before the corresponding flight, and what a huge mistake I made. First trip from Montreal to Paris was cancelled out of nowhere. No explanation was given and the only heads up I got was an email that was filtered as a spam since they sent it through a shady email. They rescheduled that flight for another one that got delayed for 2 hours. No heads up this time and of course no explanation. The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter). Needless to say that this is my first and last trip with AF. I really recommend anybody flying long distance to avoid AF at all costs, they do not seem to be able to handle the logistics of a corresponding trip."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Nice,June 2022,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety. "

Of course the airline lost the luggage and now in Bordeaux they sent an email that one cannot respond to for sending the luggage to our hotel but they gave the wrong number to call back and cannot get in touch to coordinate the lost bag reaching our hotel. 2 days after landing in Bordeaux still no bag. Stay away from this airline, I will never book with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Mumbai to Los Angeles via Paris,June 2022,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3,no,5,"  I was dissatisfied with the business class flight from Paris to Mumbai round trip. The flat bed was more like a recliner seat and my food was not up to the quality. Flight back from Paris to LAX took off late and I was very hungry. Flight attendant gave me menu, I chose salmon, she mentioned that is not available since it has been taken. No issues but when I paid a premium to travel business, should not I expect better. Given vegetarian which was very salty."

The wonderful ladies at the Air France counter at the airport were, through determined shuffling, able to accommodate all of us on the next flight to Vancouver. There was otherwise a real possibility that some of would have had to stay overnight. Kudos to the attentiveness of the Air France agents!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Rome via Paris,May 2022,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Osaka to Rome via Paris. I chose to travel with Air France  because it was the ""cheapest"" and the ""shortest"" route. I would recommend flying with them as the trip was ok, but there are things to improve! Duration of the first flight is 15 hours. Although I was worried for this very long trip, time passed quickly aboard. I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !! A particular appreciation for a female flight attendant on the flight from Osaka, and a male flight attendant on the flight to Rome. Both very kind and helpful."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Montreal,June 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,10,  Just flew from Copenhagen to Paris to Montreal on June 17th. We were behind schedule when we landed at CDG with only a small chance of making our connecting flight that day. My wife made it to the correct gate and was able to board while I ended up at the wrong gate. I would like to offer a huge thank you to Captain Emmanuel Rollier who insisted the plane would not leave until I arrived at the plane. The rest of the crew were equally supportive and helped create a positive ending to what had been a very stressful day. Thanks again to Captain and crew. 
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Vancouver,June 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1,  Horrible service and food. Very dirty bathrooms. The cushions or pillows had stains all over. Old airplane. They asked if I wanted chicken or pasta. I said pasta. They said we don’t have it and left. It’s a disgusting airline.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to mention the name of Mr Sunil Lohat who did a great job by helping us and making our journey very comfortable. I think without the help of this gentleman, it wouldn't have been possible for us to board the flight. Mr Sunil helped us till the last moment and ensured that we board the flight. He did everything which a customer needs during any technical hitches which is not known to the passenger. Hats off to such a committed and helping person.  He really made our day in the time of crisis and now I have landed Toronto without any hassles. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A220-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris CDG to Berlin,April 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,9," One way flight from Paris CDG to Berlin BER in April. A smooth and hassle-free flight on a brand new plane. The Airbus A220 is comfortable and offers free WIFI for Whatsapp and other messengers. Air France gives you a free small sandwich and a drink of your choice, alcoholic beverages included. Airport services were also fine. Check-in and security check in CDG took only a few minutes and in Berlin I got my luggage within 5 minutes. I think currently AF is the best airline in Europe."
Not Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Sint Maarten,June 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Was pleasantly surprised with Air France as I was expecting the worst experience. The aircraft felt up to date, entertainment system worked fine and had plenty of choices. Crew were very friendly and personally greeted us and asked if we needed anything. The meal services were great, the main meal was the best one I had in economy for quite sometime as mostly they are inedible but this was good, chicken with mushrooms and polenta, a small salad with Camargue rice and a delicious small pastry for dessert, coffee and wine. The meal service before landing was presented in a small gift bag and contents were tasty, a nice touch I thought."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington  to Florence via Paris CDG,June 2022,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  Delayed on initial flight for both our departure and return trips. This caused us to miss our connection. Each time Air France made it incredibly difficult to rebook. We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent. I will never take any airline that connects in CDG and will absolutely avoid Air France at all costs. The flight attendants were great and the only positive interactions we had were with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Paris via Heathrow,June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  I flew Air France return for my trip to the UK. Seats were small, service apathetic, CDG was a huge disappointment. On the way back they lost my suitcase, still MIA and no feedback from the airline. You have to hold on the phone for ages, get a surly customer service person or your call dropped."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Seoul via Amsterdam,April 2022,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,2,no,1,"  Air France / KLM lure you with the free change ticket. Unluckily, it's an hoax. To begin with, no matter what's the actual price difference, I was asked to pay an amount of money that equal/ed the price of the full ticket at minimum. Eventually, I decided to accept it and was going to pay to change the ticket for my return flight. while I was shown several options, only a tiny percentage were available to book, maybe 30%. All the rest gave a system error and a message to call their hotline, which cost me a lot of wasted time. When I called the hotline, they told the flight was available, but cost more than the full price of a one way ticket. The actual flight was OK, but this rebooking experience was so disappointing and time consuming that I cannot help but to give KLM a 0."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London Heathrow via Paris,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Awful customer service, who are clearly trained to keep you in a loop of confusion, in hope that you give up on whatever it is you need help with. Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong. It amazes me that big companies like Air France can get away with having no customer service whatsoever."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Toronto,June 2022,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,3,no,1," Paris to Toronto. I spent the last 3 weeks travelling to different parts of Europe. I have taken 5 flights total, including my flight home with Air France. I am extremely disappointed with the airport and baggage situation. I arrived at the airport and had my luggage that was not overweight and my carry on luggage that was 12kg as required and purse. I checked my luggage in and proceeded to the security. When arriving at security they weighed my carry on and indicated I had to add my purse on top. Due to my purse and carry on luggage being 14kg together. They stated my carry on or purse needed to be paid for and put through baggage or I needed to remove items and throw them out. I had to go all the way back and pay for my carry on luggage that did not have a lock and had valuable items in it to be put through with baggage. I spent 85 euros that I had no intention in spending as I ensured to make my luggage and carry on for the weight requirements. I’m extremely disappointed that this occurred and felt it was very uncalled for as this has been the only airline who requires a shoulder purse to be weighted."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Geneva to Buenos Aires via Paris ,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  First leg GVA-CDG was delayed due to circumstances outside of AF's control, I completely understand. But I still managed to get to the gate to my CDG-EZE flight with just 5-10 minutes delay. we arrived to find the plane still at the gate but boarding closed. So AF's team had to deny boarding to the 20+ passengers that arrived just a few minutes late. We were then sent to the AF counter AND were assigned a hotel some 40 minutes drive from the airport (this was almost midnight by then). We were told a shuttle would take us to the hotel. We come out to an empty parking lot, no shuttle in sight. In the end we had to google the hotel's name and pay for a uber to take us there. We arrive to the hotel (which was partially under construction) at around 1AM, and the hotel manager has no idea if and when AF will send a shuttle to bring me back to the airport. AF set me in an Iberia flight via Madrid, so I had to be back at the airport at 5.30AM.  I make it back to the airport, to find out my luggage was not transferred by AF to Iberia, so I would have to leave without it. I spent the next week in Argentina without my luggage, unsuccessfully trying to get information from AF and/or Iberia."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Paris,May 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,5,yes,8,"  Business class cabin is not the newest one in airline industry but still very good. The window seat is spacious with very much room for ones feet (perfect in flat bed mode) and very comfy. I slept very well. Privacy could be a little bit better but will be improved with the new suite type of seats for B777. IFE: Screen size and selection are good, picture quality is not on par with modern systems - but of course you can not expect this. The crew has been very friendly and helpful, food was plenty and delicious with a great starter (picture) and one of the best steaks I ever had on board (sorry, forgot to take a picture). Check in in SFO was very slow (almost 40 minutes for 12 people) but otherwise no complaints. Lounge was small and crowded, but food, beverages and WIFI were very good. I really liked the whole experience and appreciated the attentive and cordial service on board. Well done, Air France. I am looking forward to fly with you again long haul."

Shameful and inexcusable on the part of Air France."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris,May 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,1," Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris. Very disrespectful to their customers. Initially, the return flight was booked for a Saturday evening. But 2 months in advance Air France cancelled the flight. Since there was only one flight a day, we had to reschedule for the Sunday flight. Air France did not want to book a hotel or pay (part of the extra hotel costs). On check-in at Abuja, check-in was denied, because the flight was scheduled for the day before (Saturday), doh. Even though I was carrying the ticket with the new date, the booking confirmation and the e-mail about the cancellation, they refused boarding. At long last, the ticket office printed a new ticket for Sunday, and informed us, that they would not charge us at this time. On arrival in Paris, there was a technical problem with the bridge, which delayed the flight by half an hour. Air France staff refused to assist to help us catch the connecting flight. As a result, we missed the flight. At the transfer counter, the helpful staff informed us of this fact, as if we were to blame for it. On arrival in Amsterdam, of course, our bags were missing. We claimed the missing bags immediately. It took Air France a full week, to deliver the bags (from Paris to Amsterdam). When they eventually delivered the bags, one was damaged (broken handle). We also claimed the damage on the handle immediately. So far it has been 3 weeks, and Air France is not responding to any requests, nor handling our damage claim. I would row a boat to Nigeria than fly with an airline that is so disinterested in their customers. Never again."

They provided one meal ~1.5 hours after the take off and then we were starving as the last one was ~1.5 before landing. Both were unsatisfactory for such a long flight, equal to those offered in 3 hour flights of other airlines such Aegean. Also one of the flight attendants woke us up (4 people) at 4.30am while everyone was sleeping because she wanted to find her bag. She first opened the cases above our seats and after she realized that her bag was not there she poked the person sitting on the outermost seat to ask where is the bag and “why” it’s not there, loudly and visibly annoyed. So rude. For the record, the bag was in the next (front) case but I guess it’s easier to ask someone instead of looking a little further."

Having waited for a while in Mumbai for my suitcase, I finally made it to the counter to file a claim.  It took me 4 hours to get out of the airport trying to file a claim for the missing baggage. The Air France representative  Mr. Akash was nothing but polite, courteous, and a star that worked under pressure. Whilst the process was disorganized and lacked manpower, he was single-handedly managing AF travelers.  I hope they track and manage to deliver my luggage on time. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Palma de Mallorca via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,3,no,3,"  I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden. "

The main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag. The staff in the plane from Chicago to Paris was not very friendly. The staff in the way back from Paris to Chicago was very kind and helpful. Big difference. Lastly, my checked bag didn't make it to Chicago. The staff at Chicago didn't really want to help me. One spent a few moments trying to register a claim, gave up, handed me a card with instructions and walked away. I tried someone else about 15 minutes later, while she was not happy to help, she did complete the claim for me which I appreciated. The bag was delivered to my door, 200 miles from the airport, the next day was was great. I would fly Air France again."

However the Paris to Bangkok segment was excellent on all counts. The service provided by Aurelie Luche was outstanding, professional and ever so efficient and friendly. The food for the 11hour and twenty minute flight was plentiful and tasty. The overall comfort of the seat was not that outstanding but I have to say that what was my first flight with Air France it certainly won't be my last. Well done to the crew, especially to Aurelie."

Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row.

They have a very solid product. Good quality food -two services - and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch. Cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional. Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English, French and Spanish which was a bit much. Also lights a bit bright at other times. Baggage handling and check in fine on both legs. A good solid product from a classic legacy carrier."

Air France in Zanzibar does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even if you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure not to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge. When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! That’s called collecting money under false pretences!  I went online to request my gluten-free meal. I called Air France twice to confirm that the meals had been ordered. However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France forgot to provide a gluten free meal. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error. The moral of the story - if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you! That's after you pay the business class fare of $3200!"

After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart ""as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew"". So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : ""We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards"". The flight was in June, nothing has been reimbursed so far, and not even my request has been answered by October. "

Recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me. Meal selection was limited, forgot to serve me dessert. When asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin. When asking for a napkin, I was given a large table cloth. For breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea. Travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals, you need to feel welcomed and pampered. This was not the case for Air France crew on this flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Dubai,October 2022,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,4.0,5,yes,8,  One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard Wi-Fi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 10/10.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Chicago,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,2,"  I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours. The also didn't have internet on a short leg on our way to Barcelona."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Los Angeles,September 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  We got to CDG airport 3 hours before departure, and we had to run to catch the flight. Long lines, some counters were closed while the ground staff was chatting, no sense of urgency from anyone. The supervisor was less helpful than the others. When we landed at LAX, we didn't find our luggage, and AF personnel had no idea of where it was. It was left in front of the house door the following day without even ringing the bell. We found the bag broken and unrepairable and AF only reimbursed us for 15% of the value for a new bag, with no explanation. "

They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at >than 48 h after the original one. After spending a lot of time listening to their music while waiting for someone to pick up the phone in Customer Care, they hung up the phone in the middle of my question without providing useful information. They seemed very bothered by the fact that I could have used some help."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Hamburg via Paris,July 2022,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We (a family of 4) made a trip to Hamburg in early July and had a stop in Paris. Our first flight had a 2 1/2 hour delay so we couldn’t catch our connection flight. In Paris we spend over 2 hours to find someone feeling responsible for getting us on a new flight. On one of the biggest International Airports in Europe! After a delay of 6 hours we finally arrived in Hamburg, where we recognized that all our 5 Baggage pieces went missing. We immediately made an AHL Report and headed to our Vacation home without any clothes. We made necessity purchases over the 17 day vacation because our baggage still was nowhere to be found. I made a Claim on the Air France Website for those necessity purchases on day 14 of the vacation. After 21 days I made a claim for lost baggage because the baggage still hasn’t arrived. After 28 days 3 of 5 baggages arrived at our home. The remaining 2 haven’t arrived now for over 3 months. The customer Support took forever to just answer and asking simple questions about data that already has been send over and hasn’t paid any compensation yet. They write mails in which they said you have been on a totally wrong flight on a wrong date. For example they wrote we have been on a flight from Paris to Havana on October 11. Somehow they even closed the claim for the missing baggage although 2 pieces are still missing and on the date of the claim 3 pieces have been already missing for over 21 days. Their Website states that after 21 days you’re baggage is supposed to be lost and you are qualified for a compensation.  Never again Air France, worst experience ever."

When I was already seating while the plane was about to leave, the flight attendant came to ask if I still wanted to move to premium economy and pay with my miles. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the extra space on this long night flight. The premium economy seat was comfortable and the service friendly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Montpellier,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,2," An unreliable company, with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements, culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm (see picture)! We finally left with 2h delay (for a 1h flight). No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. In-flight ""business"" meal consisted of nuts, one cookie, and a drink. I don't see the difference with ""economy"". Finally arrived starved, late, having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class, all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Vancouver,September 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France, first Toronto to Paris, after being bumped by WestJet, and taking a flight a few hours later, which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver, with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary, no request was too much, and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I don’t write a lot of reviews, and I usually travel Star Alliance, but for Air France, I’ll gladly make exceptions going forward! I will see Air France in business again in April, to Paris and Lisbon, I cant wait! "

Seat space is very comfortable for economy, 81 cm much more than others offer. Good entertaining and nice crew. Free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack. Only the snack was bad and only dry bread. Delay one hour but arrived on time. Would fly Air France again."

I had a bad experience, on my flight from New York to Paris. Firstly everything was so uncoordinated, the flight got delayed, even the staff from the plane wasn’t in yet even though the boarding would be in 5 minutes. While we was flying there were many inconveniences. First the AC was so cold that I froze the whole time, secondly we flew at night (0:30) and people wanted to sleep but the lights from the airplane were fully on. It was a longer flight but we didn’t receive much to eat and when they came by with water, tea, coffee they didn’t asked me, just a few passengers."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Dubai via Paris,September 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow."

I had to buy a new ticket and it took them over 2 months to refund the previous one. Aircrafts were fine, service was standard for long haul. 3 pieces of luggage delayed for 75 days, no information from their customer service, hard to reach and rude. Worst experience with an airline, they'll never see me again."

CDG could be a small downside for a few people but I've always loved it, even though everything might take a few more minutes, I have always like it because it's beautiful!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Paris via Budapest,April 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The airline sold me a ticket, changing in Paris, but left nowhere near enough time to get through security and run across the airport. It was pretty humiliating, and the staff were incredibly rude. When I complained about it, the customer service lady threatened to cancel my return ticket and actually dismissed me with a 'dusting off her hands' motion. They have completely ignored my request for a refund (it left me £233 out of pocket and with a ruined trip. It took all day just to get home)."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to New York via Paris CDG,January 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My original flight had mechanical problems while in flight, so we diverted to Milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of New York-JFK. It was an awful ordeal. I submitted a delay compensation request back in January, and they finally approved it in September (more than 8 months to process!), but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation. I supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers. They have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point, and now after eight months of waiting, they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount. All I'm asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the European Union. Nothing more, nothing less. "

The mini croissant served on the E190 was tasty. As for the food on the A350, it was satisfying enough but was not up to my expectations. Flight attendants were smiling."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Paris via Bangaluru,September 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,7," Excellent service at Bengaluru. Due to the short time in b/w transfers one bag did not arrive. However Air France had already sent a list of missing baggage and they informed us whilst we were at the luggage carousel, this saving us time. They tracked where our baggage was and sent it on the next flight. It arrived safely. Very helpful staff at Bengaluru who helped us when we were tired and stressed. Thank you Air France! Re food though it's a different review as the quality was poor, food passed off as Indian, really wasn't food any Indian would eat!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Conakry to London Heathrow via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,2," Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa. Terrible airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,First Class,Montréal to Paris,September 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,9," Excellent flight from Paris to Montréal, I wouldn't have recommended Air France 6 or 7 years ago, but this airline is really improving. The cabin crew was pleasing and careful, the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class. The only negative point is that Paris CDG is really disorganized, it is probably one of the worst airports I've had experienced with Amsterdam AMS in Europe. I really hope that it will improve within the next years."
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Zurich,August 2022,2.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight from Zurich to Paris was an hour late.  My return flight experience was worse: I paid for a Siège Plus (11D) with extra legroom. However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag. Between AF and the useless local transporter, I have wasted two days. Is this how AF treats its passengers? Is a Flying Blue Gold member impressed by this experience? I am very frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism from start to finish. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bangalore via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day. You saved us and we are truly grateful. We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Trondheim to London via Amsterdam,April 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Punta Cana via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to say that the airline and cabin crew were absolutely brilliant. They were very attentive and in hand if we needed them. The inflight food was delicious and tasty, not bland like other airlines. We pre-paid for our seats and we’re very pleased with the extra leg room outbound and the Solo seats coming home. I would like to thank all the staff from check in until when we landed. So professional and quick so the queues were small and manageable. Air France made our holiday more amazing by delivering such a wonderful experience. Thank You."

I have travelled from OTP to JFK via CDG and return in business class. A great experience from the lounge, food, beverages to the comfort of the seat. On the return segment JFK -CDG I was upgraded in La Premiere due to my Platinum Ultimate status. The onboard service was state of the art. The champagne the best I have ever tasted. The FAs and the pursers attitude and service flow less. Looking forward to my next trip with AF."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Prague,August 2022,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage. They weigh both bags and if both bags are even 1KG over their 12 KG weight limit they make you walk back to the Air France check-in area to spend 110 euros and 25 minutes to check one bag (not both bags even though they were both weighed together). This would make sense if the luggage was oversized and didn’t fit in the overhead bins but our small luggage was overweight was because we travel with large books. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Beirut via Manchester / Paris,July 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight for an Air France / Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to Beirut. Once I landed in Beirut airport I notice I'm missing one checked bag so I reached out to the missing luggage office and file claim. 2 days later I got update by email that my bag was found, and it will be forwarded to Beirut. I contacted airport for my bag, and they said my bag did not arrive. 2 days later suddenly the claim I filed in the airport was closed and when I contacted customer service, they didn't know how the claim was closed or who closed it. I filed online claim again, since then I have been calling customer service every day about my luggage with no updates. Nobody could explain how my first claim was closed and keep saying no update on my luggage. I filed claim for necessary purchase but I didn't get any reimbursement, then after 21 days filed claim for lost luggage. I started calling air France every day, I got to speak with supervisor who made clear your bag was lost and there is no way for passenger to talk to claim department unless they call you. I asked how long it takes to get my reimbursement, he said, we have long queue and this might take several months. So they lost my bag with promise they will reimburse me when they decide to do with no timeframe. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris CDG,July 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,4,yes,6,"  We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change. Still, I live in hope that Air France ups its game on the service front."

I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner. Shame on Air France. I've never encountered such incompetence."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,August 2022,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We just had a return flight scheduled via Air France on August 1st. We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags. We are told to return in the morning to pick up our other 2 large checked bags that had been pulled from the plane. We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address. Unbelievable service from Air France. No apologies from anyone or care for the extraordinary mess of lines! One bag has been found but the other is untraceable."

Lounge welcome none, food not eatable, Champagne from a cheap brand. These are the only bad news from 2 flights that went smoothly, with excellent on-board service. 16 years old 777, retrofitted, but showing signals of usage. Small (14 seats) business class cabin, therefore very quiet. Connecting in CDG was made easy, with separate immigration for connecting passengers. Lounge in CDG was packed at 6:00 AM ! As usual MRS baggage delivery at MRS is a shame, with no respect for priority bags. Not AF fault; just bad service form third party services."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Paris ,August 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1," Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir. Avoid Air France's archaic customer service system at all costs."
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Rome to Lisbon Via Paris,June 2022,,,,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  Booked a business class flight from Rome to Lisbon Via Paris, completed online check-in, submitted the requested COVID Certificate, and received the Ready to Fly email from Air France, meaning everything I submitted was good to go. Arrived at the departing Airport only to be told that my seat was cancelled, my allocated seat was sold to another passenger, and it was now a sold-out flight. It's been a fight to get my refund. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Paris to Düsseldorf,June 2022,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached. All in all very disappointing."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris,June 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight was canceled on June 17, 2022. It was supposed to depart at 11:55 pm and 30 minutes Before we were supposed to take off they canceled it and told us they are going to give us a hotel to stay in until they get us a new flight, but 4 hours waiting in the airport until they got us a hotel in Manhattan witch is an hour away from the airport. After that they told us to pay for everything we need and save a copy of the receipt and send it to the airline for a refund. I ended up paying around 300 dollars and I still haven’t gotten the money back and it’s been almost 2 months!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Punta Cana via Paris,July 2022,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  This airline have 2 people working at the check in counter where you get there early and spend more than 2 hours waiting on a line even tho they know your flight is about to leave and you need to pass through security. Also they are losing luggage, and if they find one of them was open (even when you put a lock on it) with a lot of missing items. They did not answer the claims made."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to New York ,July 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I make several international trips a year. This trips' flights with Air France were clearly the worst. We were only on this AF flight with our Delta reservations because of code sharing. Not only were the flight attendants condescending, food inedible and the ground service bizarre,  to add insult to injury, they lost our luggage and cannot locate it. AF's service desk is impossible to get on the phone. I have been trying for a day and a half since we returned to ask about the status of my missing luggage. We called Delta and after a wait of over an hour were told we should have called AF. Finally after a wait of over 2 hours we got a person to speak at AF -- the person manning the phones said they live in a status of perpetual wonderment as to where the luggage was and had certainly no idea where mine was. Frustration, upset, anger, disappointment. I will never fly Air France again. If you have an option, take another airline unless you can pack all your clothes in a carry on. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington, DC to Athens via Paris",June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1," We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you. We were not the only people who spent the night at the airport, there were many families with kids who slept on the floor. Absolutely horrible the way they speak to you and also condescending."

The staff was really friendly and helpful, I had a problem with my entertainment device and they quickly fixed it for me. The food was good and the service was perfect, it was possible to ask for drinks or snacks for free which is a big plus. The ambient lights made the flight more enjoyable and the plane was beautiful. I had no problem to retrieve my luggage or to board my flight. I'll definitely fly with Air France again, thank you !"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320/A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Marseille to Montreal via paris,July 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5,yes,9,"  Air France ground staff in Marseille were helpful as they anticipate our flight to CDG, in order to be sure that we would catch our transatlantic flight. However boarding at Marseille was one of the most messy I have ever seen, due to the lack of instructions of staff. Direct channel from Terminal 2F to Terminal 2E (K), with dedicated immigration and no security check was of great relief. Splendid. Catering at lounge was excellent. Boarding of flight to YUL was also a torture, as we had to wait under the sun (during the heat wave) on a ramp during more than 20 minutes. On the other hand service, food and comfort on AF A350 Business class were exceptional, showing a brutal improvement. Air France could have deserved a 10, if they had learned to board with SQ staff."

✅ Trip Verified ,A320/A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Lisbon via Paris,June 2022,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3.0,5,yes,7,"  Online check-in and bag drop at Heathrow were straightforward, but the boarding procedure was cumbersome due to an apparent shortage of people at the gate (only 1 for most of the time). A gate between the queue to enter the departure lounge and the lounge itself was left open and one passenger managed to wander through, by-passing the gate agent. Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks). Probably because of the slow boarding process at Heathrow our first leg to CDG operated 25 minutes late, resulting in us having to sprint up and down staircases at CDG to catch our onward flight to Lisbon. Our baggage made it too -- phew! All in all this was a pleasant experience, especially onboard."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Chennai via Paris,June 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,no,3,  One of the worst baggage service I ever seen. I travelled on end of June and still not received my missing baggage. 10 days back Got a mail saying your baggage was found and it’s on your way but after I haven’t received any information from the airline. Very disappointed with the service. Now I have to travel back to my place without my bag.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to New York via Paris CDG,July 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They have no process in place to smoothly inform people how to declare missing baggage and how to schedule a delivery. I've called the help line over 12 times and have been on hold for upwards of 45 minutes before the line hanging up on me. None of the support options seem to work and I've done my best to be patient, but I would really like an update. On the flight, we were given our meals and for an hour and a half, they let our trays sit there. They didn't pick up the trays for so long that people were helping each other out by holding their trash so they could move about the cabin. The flight attendants were nice, even if not very prompt. They seemed as upset about the situation as we were. I'm still on hold (day 2 trying to speak to someone) as I write this review. "

Air France staff was courteous, attentive and polite. The food was better than I could have imagined, we were served both dinner and breakfast. We flew on the Boeing 777-300ER first row in business class (First Class for this particular plane), the plane was a newer version, has ample leg room with an angled flat bed for comfortable seating. The aircraft was clean and everything in my seating area was in working order. My next trip back to Senegal will be with Air France!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Naples to Paris CDG via New York JFK,July 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Do not use Air France if you have another option! We were scheduled to leave Italy at 6.10 am on July 12, to catch a connecting flight in Paris to JFK. The night before they changed our flight to 7.45 am so we would miss our connecting flight. Instead of scheduling the next available flight from Paris to JFK, they changed our connecting flight multiple times and in the end, we had a 14 hour delay in the airport. No one communicated the reason for this long delay, we can only assume that they gave our seats away to the passengers that had already been stuck in the airport for 24-48 hours for a plane to JFK. The only compensation Air France offered us was a $31 food voucher for five passengers to hold us over for a fourteen hour delay. It is apparent that this airline is not at all prepared to accommodate the influx of passengers flying their airline and definitely does not respect their passengers time. We will never fly this airline again!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lyon to Venice via Paris,July 2022,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The tickets for our flight were bought online, yet at check-in, we were told the flight was full and that we had to board a different flight with a stop over at Amsterdam. We were originally going from Lyon to Venice. The new route costed us a delay of more than 2 hours. Each flight we boarded, or checked-in for, we were told they did not have a seat for us until everyone else had boarded. It felt like we had bought last-minute budget tickets and treated less than everybody else. Yet we had spent a large amount to travel to Venice. The entire journey we were still grateful we could fly and hopeful we could get to our destination. It was stressful to say the least. This has been a bad experience and I don't recommend Air France."

The flight was delayed for two hours and when we arrive, we had to wait for another hour to find that there was no luggage. It is now the 14/07/2022 and I still don't have my luggage! Last Saturday, I received a message saying the luggage was found. But I have not received the luggage yet. Therefore, and considering the very long time I have been without luggage and without actually managing to talk, exchange messages or even smoke signs with Air France, I found the company unreliable with a terrible customer service.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Newcastle via Paris,July 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,1,"  What a shambles and I will never fly with Air France again. This flight was 1.5 hours late, which seems normal for that flight.  AF had tried to throw me off my connecting flight and put me on one for the next day but the check-in girl at BKK managed to reverse it and I made the flight. I asked on exit how far away my next gate was but they didn’t have a clue. A 2-3-2 business class is decades out of date and the cabin crew were men who did their job in a minimalist manner but there was no friendliness or engagement with the passengers, downright miserable. The food felt very overly reheated. There looks like a lot of pages of movies but a lot of it was many copies of the same film, no idea what that was about as you choose your language when you click on play. They get round their terrible performance by using that awful and insulting catch-all phrase, “For operational reasons”. When we landed at CDG there was another plane still at our gate."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Birmingham ,June 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  My trip is over and I have still not received my bag. Horrible service. They do not answer phone calls or respond to emails. They literally left me high and dry. The fact that my holiday is over and still no correspondence from this retched airline I feel is reason enough not to fly with them. Honestly ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing time.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Paris,June 2022,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The check in lines were long and there were not enough staff. The flight delayed for over an hour, more than 5 baggage were lost in a flight which causing a long queue on the luggage center. However, there were only two staff there. The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing. So basically if you take Air France and the baggage is lost during the flight, you will not be able to do anything and no one from Air France can help you."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Berlin,July 2022,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,3,no,5,"  I flew with Air France on flight AF1424 on 3rd July 2022 from Paris to Berlin. I knew there were cases of large queues for luggage check-ins and anticipating this, I left for the airport 4 hrs earlier and arrived 3.5hrs earlier than my flight time. And as expected, the line was huge. Despite the fact that they had automatic machines where you could check in your luggage, those machines opened late and 3-5 members of Air France were operating those counters. When the machines started running, people did not know how to use them. For example, if your bag were overweight by a certain threshold, the machine would get stuck. Thus, requiring human interference (or maybe people just didn’t know) to make it start working again. Secondly, the machine did not mention that you need to check in your hand luggage also. So, people had to come back from security. There was also a long line of people printing luggage tags after getting in line. Thus coming back and forth into the queues and stalling the people behind them. There were people just getting in line without waiting for their turn.  Some of the cabin crew were gloomy."

All we were told was to go to gate K57 and arrangements would be made. Only arrangement was made for business class passengers as if rest were travelling for free. Air France lounges denied entry even after many were ready to pay charges from pocket. It is 12.03 at night and no one from Air France has come."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Firenze to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Thank you Air France for providing exceptional customer service. I read these reviews and they mostly appear to be only a bad experience. But my experience had the potential to be bad, but you handled it exceedingly well. My flight from Firenze to CDG was going to arrive late and I would miss my connection. In flight, the attendant told me I was going to miss the connection, my new flight was already booked for the next day, and that I would be provided a hotel and meals. When I arrived every word of this was true. I stayed in a very nice airport hotel (Golden Lotus) that provided exceptional buffet style food, I used the hotel shuttle, and you also gave me a meal voucher as well for the airport. I was concerned leaving my luggage overnight in the airport, but it arrived safely in LAX the following day. You could not have made this any easier, and I was really only delayed about 12 hours in total. I've flown with you 3 times now to Italy and you will always be my first choice. Yes, occasionally I may experience an inconvenience, but I will always remember how you handled this perfectly. My only suggestion for the foreign traveler would be maybe to have a printed map (handed to them by the flight attendant) with the details where the Air France Customer Service kiosk is located, and also where the hotel shuttles are located. It's such a huge airport and this took me a little time to navigate."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Paris via Tunis,June 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3," I take a yearly trip to Tunisia, and I've flown with a lot of airlines over the years. I have encountered delays and issues with flight logistics but it was always handled smoothly and professionally by the airline. This time I tried Air France because they offered a trip without much waiting time before the corresponding flight, and what a huge mistake I made. First trip from Montreal to Paris was cancelled out of nowhere. No explanation was given and the only heads up I got was an email that was filtered as a spam since they sent it through a shady email. They rescheduled that flight for another one that got delayed for 2 hours. No heads up this time and of course no explanation. The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter). Needless to say that this is my first and last trip with AF. I really recommend anybody flying long distance to avoid AF at all costs, they do not seem to be able to handle the logistics of a corresponding trip."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Nice,June 2022,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety. "

Of course the airline lost the luggage and now in Bordeaux they sent an email that one cannot respond to for sending the luggage to our hotel but they gave the wrong number to call back and cannot get in touch to coordinate the lost bag reaching our hotel. 2 days after landing in Bordeaux still no bag. Stay away from this airline, I will never book with them again."

The flat bed was more like a recliner seat and my food was not up to the quality. Flight back from Paris to LAX took off late and I was very hungry. Flight attendant gave me menu, I chose salmon, she mentioned that is not available since it has been taken. No issues but when I paid a premium to travel business, should not I expect better. Given vegetarian which was very salty."

The wonderful ladies at the Air France counter at the airport were, through determined shuffling, able to accommodate all of us on the next flight to Vancouver. There was otherwise a real possibility that some of would have had to stay overnight. Kudos to the attentiveness of the Air France agents!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Rome via Paris,May 2022,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Osaka to Rome via Paris. I chose to travel with Air France  because it was the ""cheapest"" and the ""shortest"" route. I would recommend flying with them as the trip was ok, but there are things to improve! Duration of the first flight is 15 hours. Although I was worried for this very long trip, time passed quickly aboard. I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !! A particular appreciation for a female flight attendant on the flight from Osaka, and a male flight attendant on the flight to Rome. Both very kind and helpful."

We were behind schedule when we landed at CDG with only a small chance of making our connecting flight that day. My wife made it to the correct gate and was able to board while I ended up at the wrong gate. I would like to offer a huge thank you to Captain Emmanuel Rollier who insisted the plane would not leave until I arrived at the plane. The rest of the crew were equally supportive and helped create a positive ending to what had been a very stressful day. Thanks again to Captain and crew.

Old airplane. They asked if I wanted chicken or pasta. I said pasta. They said we don’t have it and left. It’s a disgusting airline.

I think without the help of this gentleman, it wouldn't have been possible for us to board the flight. Mr Sunil helped us till the last moment and ensured that we board the flight. He did everything which a customer needs during any technical hitches which is not known to the passenger. Hats off to such a committed and helping person.  He really made our day in the time of crisis and now I have landed Toronto without any hassles. "

A smooth and hassle-free flight on a brand new plane. The Airbus A220 is comfortable and offers free WIFI for Whatsapp and other messengers. Air France gives you a free small sandwich and a drink of your choice, alcoholic beverages included. Airport services were also fine. Check-in and security check in CDG took only a few minutes and in Berlin I got my luggage within 5 minutes. I think currently AF is the best airline in Europe."
Not Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Sint Maarten,June 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Was pleasantly surprised with Air France as I was expecting the worst experience. The aircraft felt up to date, entertainment system worked fine and had plenty of choices. Crew were very friendly and personally greeted us and asked if we needed anything. The meal services were great, the main meal was the best one I had in economy for quite sometime as mostly they are inedible but this was good, chicken with mushrooms and polenta, a small salad with Camargue rice and a delicious small pastry for dessert, coffee and wine. The meal service before landing was presented in a small gift bag and contents were tasty, a nice touch I thought."

This caused us to miss our connection. Each time Air France made it incredibly difficult to rebook. We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent. I will never take any airline that connects in CDG and will absolutely avoid Air France at all costs. The flight attendants were great and the only positive interactions we had were with them."

To begin with, no matter what's the actual price difference, I was asked to pay an amount of money that equal/ed the price of the full ticket at minimum. Eventually, I decided to accept it and was going to pay to change the ticket for my return flight. while I was shown several options, only a tiny percentage were available to book, maybe 30%. All the rest gave a system error and a message to call their hotline, which cost me a lot of wasted time. When I called the hotline, they told the flight was available, but cost more than the full price of a one way ticket. The actual flight was OK, but this rebooking experience was so disappointing and time consuming that I cannot help but to give KLM a 0."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London Heathrow via Paris,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Awful customer service, who are clearly trained to keep you in a loop of confusion, in hope that you give up on whatever it is you need help with. Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong. It amazes me that big companies like Air France can get away with having no customer service whatsoever."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Toronto,June 2022,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,3,no,1," Paris to Toronto. I spent the last 3 weeks travelling to different parts of Europe. I have taken 5 flights total, including my flight home with Air France. I am extremely disappointed with the airport and baggage situation. I arrived at the airport and had my luggage that was not overweight and my carry on luggage that was 12kg as required and purse. I checked my luggage in and proceeded to the security. When arriving at security they weighed my carry on and indicated I had to add my purse on top. Due to my purse and carry on luggage being 14kg together. They stated my carry on or purse needed to be paid for and put through baggage or I needed to remove items and throw them out. I had to go all the way back and pay for my carry on luggage that did not have a lock and had valuable items in it to be put through with baggage. I spent 85 euros that I had no intention in spending as I ensured to make my luggage and carry on for the weight requirements. I’m extremely disappointed that this occurred and felt it was very uncalled for as this has been the only airline who requires a shoulder purse to be weighted."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Geneva to Buenos Aires via Paris ,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  First leg GVA-CDG was delayed due to circumstances outside of AF's control, I completely understand. But I still managed to get to the gate to my CDG-EZE flight with just 5-10 minutes delay. we arrived to find the plane still at the gate but boarding closed. So AF's team had to deny boarding to the 20+ passengers that arrived just a few minutes late. We were then sent to the AF counter AND were assigned a hotel some 40 minutes drive from the airport (this was almost midnight by then). We were told a shuttle would take us to the hotel. We come out to an empty parking lot, no shuttle in sight. In the end we had to google the hotel's name and pay for a uber to take us there. We arrive to the hotel (which was partially under construction) at around 1AM, and the hotel manager has no idea if and when AF will send a shuttle to bring me back to the airport. AF set me in an Iberia flight via Madrid, so I had to be back at the airport at 5.30AM.  I make it back to the airport, to find out my luggage was not transferred by AF to Iberia, so I would have to leave without it. I spent the next week in Argentina without my luggage, unsuccessfully trying to get information from AF and/or Iberia."

The window seat is spacious with very much room for ones feet (perfect in flat bed mode) and very comfy. I slept very well. Privacy could be a little bit better but will be improved with the new suite type of seats for B777. IFE: Screen size and selection are good, picture quality is not on par with modern systems - but of course you can not expect this. The crew has been very friendly and helpful, food was plenty and delicious with a great starter (picture) and one of the best steaks I ever had on board (sorry, forgot to take a picture). Check in in SFO was very slow (almost 40 minutes for 12 people) but otherwise no complaints. Lounge was small and crowded, but food, beverages and WIFI were very good. I really liked the whole experience and appreciated the attentive and cordial service on board. Well done, Air France. I am looking forward to fly with you again long haul."

Six months now and no resolution to a delayed baggage claim for purchasing incidentals totaling about $350. I will travel back to W.

Shameful and inexcusable on the part of Air France."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris,May 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,1," Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris. Very disrespectful to their customers. Initially, the return flight was booked for a Saturday evening. But 2 months in advance Air France cancelled the flight. Since there was only one flight a day, we had to reschedule for the Sunday flight. Air France did not want to book a hotel or pay (part of the extra hotel costs). On check-in at Abuja, check-in was denied, because the flight was scheduled for the day before (Saturday), doh. Even though I was carrying the ticket with the new date, the booking confirmation and the e-mail about the cancellation, they refused boarding. At long last, the ticket office printed a new ticket for Sunday, and informed us, that they would not charge us at this time. On arrival in Paris, there was a technical problem with the bridge, which delayed the flight by half an hour. Air France staff refused to assist to help us catch the connecting flight. As a result, we missed the flight. At the transfer counter, the helpful staff informed us of this fact, as if we were to blame for it. On arrival in Amsterdam, of course, our bags were missing. We claimed the missing bags immediately. It took Air France a full week, to deliver the bags (from Paris to Amsterdam). When they eventually delivered the bags, one was damaged (broken handle). We also claimed the damage on the handle immediately. So far it has been 3 weeks, and Air France is not responding to any requests, nor handling our damage claim. I would row a boat to Nigeria than fly with an airline that is so disinterested in their customers. Never again."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Havana,May 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2,no,3,"  Very poor meals for a 10hour flight (Paris CDG to Havana). They provided one meal ~1.5 hours after the take off and then we were starving as the last one was ~1.5 before landing. Both were unsatisfactory for such a long flight, equal to those offered in 3 hour flights of other airlines such Aegean. Also one of the flight attendants woke us up (4 people) at 4.30am while everyone was sleeping because she wanted to find her bag. She first opened the cases above our seats and after she realized that her bag was not there she poked the person sitting on the outermost seat to ask where is the bag and “why” it’s not there, loudly and visibly annoyed. So rude. For the record, the bag was in the next (front) case but I guess it’s easier to ask someone instead of looking a little further."

Having waited for a while in Mumbai for my suitcase, I finally made it to the counter to file a claim.  It took me 4 hours to get out of the airport trying to file a claim for the missing baggage. The Air France representative  Mr. Akash was nothing but polite, courteous, and a star that worked under pressure. Whilst the process was disorganized and lacked manpower, he was single-handedly managing AF travelers.  I hope they track and manage to deliver my luggage on time. "

Started off well with excellent check in at first at t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies. Watch out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October. As always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots."
Not Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Keflavik to London Heathrow,December 2022,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19th. On the face of it, that was sensible as the weather in Iceland was appalling. However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport. I got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad. If they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed. I am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins. Having checked today, as I type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to Keflavík being closed! Do they not check these things? Any help from BA offered - not really."
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Frankfurt,October 2022,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  BA cancelled my flight home, the last flight of the day into Heathrow, and tried to push me onto another flight to London City 3 hours later! My car was at Heathrow. I didn't want to try and cross London late at night on public transport with luggage, especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time. I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all be it another terminal) on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on. It's such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience. BA have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey we've booked this year. We are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service."

Long queues at security due to only 4 lines open. People stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded. Missed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next one. Received a voucher, approx £6 for the whole day. Arrived 1 day later, my suitcase didn’t arrive with me. Filed a claim at the desk, for 5 days no update, no information, no offer of compensation and no solution offer. I now have a spoilt holiday, many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don’t know if I will be reimbursed. Beware with BA, expect low level or zero customer service, old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing. I will personally avoid BA in future at all costs."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London Gatwick to Cancun,November 2022,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Boarding – at gate at LGW they called Group 1 to board (we were World Traveller Plus & Group 3), then called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward. Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew. We will not be looking to fly BA over Virgin in future."

I arrived back in Phoenix on Sunday evening and air tags showed my bags arrived on Monday, but it took three more days before they were finally delivered. I understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in London my luggage did not make it onto my final flight. I filled out the required form at the Phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where I received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email, but no email was received. I made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and I should hear back within 24 hours. Finally the email with the tracking number was received on Tuesday night. I went online with the tracking number on Wednesday and it requested that I provide the same information that I had given them on the form at the airport. My luggage was finally delivered on Thursday afternoon. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,London to Rome,December 2022,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,1.0,4,yes,6,"  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class. She kept touching her face, not making eye contact with passengers, and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there."

About six months ago BA announced they were switching planes to the old antique push-me-pull-you layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics. Sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room (eight seats across), worn out fittings, inedible food and surly FAs."

I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better. I've obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades, but everything else was good."

Excellent service, attentive staff, first drink service, then meal service (choice of three meals), later second drink service. In reality - excellent flight. Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet). Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve. Constantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet). I don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you. I was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes-like bites and some drink. Why would we bother serving you also a scone. Hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when I asked for my scone it came as a surprise I was not served any (no co-ordination between the crew).  Crew busy chatting at the galley. In reality - the service could not get any worse. One just must ask what do you pay the premium price for? "

What outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldn't even order any food / drink because the card reader didn't function. The first and last time we'll fly with BA.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Business,Economy Class,Denver to London,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I was flying to Warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami the next day. Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there. I mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami the next day.

It took a while but BA did eventually make good on their promise, thank you. Based on things now being resolved I have travelled on BA since and I am booked to travel to South Africa in First class on 2nd January, looking forward to the new BA Concorde lounge. Keep it up BA, loyalty is indeed a 2way street."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to London,November 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,2," Extremely sub-par service. Highlights: No online meal selection. Staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. Last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. Plates were literally grabbed away. I had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. No apology. No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. Staff walked down with some water and biscuits. This got exhausted just before she got to me. She just looked at me and walked away. Nothing further was offered."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Lisbon,November 2022,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3.0,3,yes,7,"  I virtually gave up on British Airways about three years ago, writing off my Avios and opting for other airlines. But my return flights from Heathrow to Lisbon this week were very good. The aircraft were pretty much full, but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good. A particular shout-out to a flight attendant called Jo, but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive. I'm going to have to start spending those Avios."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787 / A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Edinburgh via London Heathrow,January 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"  I was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather. The flight from Montreal was my return flight to Scotland, but I originally booked to fly to and from Toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and I rebooked for a cheaper flight. The inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. As well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. While the food was typical air plane food. I thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Budapest via London,November 2022,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  British Airways is late, their website is atrocious, and they wouldn't let me check-in until 24 hours before the flight. I have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website, and/or find a real person to speak with. Customer service had such a thick accent I didn't think they were speaking English. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Amman Jordan to London UK (Heathrow),November 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,4.0,2,no,4, Flew from Amman to London on Nov. 14 2022. Not sure what type of aircraft it was. My Ticket was economy plus. The flight is 5h35m. We received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. The seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. Any other food or drink had to be purchased. So we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. It is the third time I have flown with BA recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. Will honestly never fly them again if I can help it.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dusseldorf to London via Los Angeles,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Cape Town,November 2022,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. LHR T5 smooth and calm. Checking process quick. - But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  Ran back to checkin to get correct one. Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). Overall experience 2/10. Flew Air France (Fortalaza to CDG to LHR) two weeks earlier which was way better. How embarrassing for BA."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Dallas via London ,November 2022,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1,no,1," Worst experience ever. Outbound flight was cancelled and I was not notified. I was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip. Inbound flight delayed 1 hour, also not notified. On top of it, they boarded my hand luggage, which was the only bag I had. Extra wait in Milan then. Food is horrible."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to London Heathrow,November 2022,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,3,yes,5,"  Check in was a shambles at BWI, just 3 counters open for a very full flight. The bag drop queue was even longer than the regular check-in queue! Boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! The plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to T5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. Overall, I rate this just as a mediocre journey."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Dubai to Belfast via London,October 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1, Beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to BA. Two pieces reported 29th September. BA responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. All this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world. Disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Bologna via London,July 2022,5.0,5.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," On July 19th 2022 I had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that BA had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to Italy and we've lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them, for which I had provided all copy of receipts for. I requested for my expenses to be reimbursed, they agreed, I sent all requested information and was told in 2 weeks I will be receiving it. It's 4 months later and British Airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow-ups on the matter."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to London,October 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I booked the flight on Oct 8, but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that I can't get my entry visa in time for the flight. And I did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. But in the cancellation email, the booking reference number is a different one. So I requested cancellation, but BA canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email? I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! And it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to BA. I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. Based on my experience, no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put in. Given all I have experienced, I have zero faith in British Airways."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Gibraltar,October 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,3,no,6,  London to Gibraltar on 25th October 2022. I booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  BA attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. Offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where BA aim to be positioned at of late. The A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. The staff disappeared for most of the flight. The flight was punctual but I felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience. 
Not Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Nairobi,October 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I’ve generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with BA if they fly the route I’m after but my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. We should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr + flight. Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. They were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board. We’re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in July for the cancellation of our flight to Miami in March. This was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight !"
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-1000,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Los Angeles,October 2022,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,yes,9,"  A great flight. The suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort. British has returned to full service so meals were coursed, menus and hot towels provided…etc Food was quite good with choices provided for both meals. Service was ok, I prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference. Entertainment was good as was connectivity. No real complaints except a minor one. The tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position. I actually felt like I was in a true business class, not by Qatar’s standards, but that’s another story."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Copenhagen to Heathrow,October 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4.0,5,yes,9,"  I am happy to say that this flight was quite good. Except for the second rate Euro business seating, everything was very well done. A friendly, informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about Heathrow transit. Well done. Unfortunately, a bus gate was used upon arrival."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Larnaca to London,October 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,2,no,3,"  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-10,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Atlanta to London,October 2022,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,9,"  A very positive experience with BA. Seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep. Food was fine but not outstanding. Wi-Fi good, and video screen large and bright. Baggage came out very quickly at Heathrow, had the same experience on the return flight to Atlanta. All in all, would fly BA again, but would probably want to make sure it is new seats."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Madrid to San Francisco via London,September 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,1,no,2," Baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered. A380 is a great aircraft but the BA seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)"
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Washington,October 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,2.0,5,yes,8,"  Evening flight from LHR to IAD on an A380. Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. Boarding was very poorly managed. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. The IFE was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and TV programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. The seat was comfortable but legroom was tight. All in, it was an uneventful journey and I would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to San Francisco,October 2022,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,October 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,4.0,1,no,3,"  While entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that I was suffocating. I got faint due to that heat, but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time. Other then that when I called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Los Angeles,October 2022,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"  LHR-LAX. I prefer the Boeing 777 over the A380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. Check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at Heathrow. T5 is a whole other story. Once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. I have been in and out of Heathrow many times but never in T5 before. Anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. It was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so I occupied my time with several movies. Nice landing at LAX. All in all BA was just fine."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to London Heathrow,October 2022,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,4.0,3,yes,8,"  Flew back to UK from Miami in new Club World Suite - a huge improvement on the elderly Yin and Yang style Club World. Boarding easy. Took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. Very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FA's - especially Anna who addressed me by name). However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. Refused to pay BA's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. C'mon BA - do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class ? I can recommend BA's new Club Class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Dubai to London,October 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3,yes,9,  I flew with hand baggage but security at Dubai was quick. Entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound. Flight on A380 left on time. Few technical issues with IFE which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight. Decent snack and slept well. Arrivals lounge excellent. Would recommend.
Not Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Cairo,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,4.0,1,no,1," London to Cairo. First, on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water. Even Southwest is more generous. When unable to connect my phone to order food, I hit the FA call button with no response for more than an hour. When the FA came to collect garbage I had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter. He used his phone to place the order."

Not Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to London,September 2022,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,3,yes,6,"  DFW-LHR. Had an easy transfer at DFW from American Airlines to British Airways heading to London. First ride on an A380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice. Was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very cramped. When the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. The seat itself wasn't too bad but I felt squished and locked in. On a plus side, having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side. Ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice. Plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night. Dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack. The entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies, tv, music and games. All in all it was an OK experience and did get me to London on time and our baggage arrived safely, but I'm not sold on the A380. T5 at LHR is another story that will be in a different review. What a mess that place is."
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Jersey to London Heathrow,September 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3.0,4,yes,7,  Check in at Jersey straightforward. There is a small business class lounge at Jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food. Flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at LHR. Captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at Heathrow. Good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served. Disappointing that the wait for cases at Heathrow T5 was as long as the flight!
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Jersey,September 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,3.0,4,yes,8,"  Check in at LHR T5 was very quick and queue for security short. We used the South Lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. Flight boarded on time. Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Glass of champagne, Coronation Chicken Salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter. In spite of some of the issues with BA, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception. Flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to London Heathrow,September 2022,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2,no,3," The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to New York JFK,September 2022,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9," This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Gothenburg to Jersey via London,June 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow - Jersey. However, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel to my destination. If I have a choice, I will never travel BA again. Such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs."

My flight into London was delayed, security had long lines, I ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board (the software program was already closed). This while the flight manager, who came towards the gate, urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line. I was sweating from the run, still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board. I bolted again into the plane feeling bad that I did not personally thank her for her magic. I really hope she gets recognized by British Airways for her performance. Thank you for all you do !"

British Airways Business Class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty. Front rows about 5-7 are considered as Business Class, with very short leg space.

First of all, the improvement in the BA lounge in Gatwick is massive. The buffet was a joy. We flew on a BA flight but operated by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service. I am still not clear on luggage being labelled ""priority"". The luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports."

Today I clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a fee. I then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately I received a response saying my voucher is on its way. I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. So they now have my money and I have to re-book at full cost. In the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up."

They cancelled my return flight from Heathrow back to Manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered. We had to get our son come all the way to London to pick us up and take us to our car in Manchester. The food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night. I will not be flying BA again

We found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. We had to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. We returned home with Aer Lingus with no drama."

She greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile, she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books. Her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing. She had time for a quick chat and I think she said she was half German and half Bulgarian, a really lovely young lady who is a credit to British Airways."

They delay my transfer to the next day, okay, not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test, but when I try to check in at Changi Airport, the Philippines Airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test. Had to rush to a different terminal, get tested, wait for the result, rush back to check in ...the gate had closed.  Had to book an extra night in Singapore hotel, book my own flight to Manila, then also the return journey back to London. If one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  I discovered Oman Air Business Class and better then British Airways, from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Barcelona,June 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from Heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, I boarded the plane on this basis. I was subsequently dumped at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. There was no help at there to find a hotel. I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers. So for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with BA."

Let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to London and missed our connecting flight back to NY. The reason writing this review is the great customer service that Kashmir Dhami gave us. She was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day, which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult, but she got it done! She is so kind and is amazing at her job."

Just got off the call with him, after their arrival at Heathrow. Shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and I have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from RSA, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. My grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignored. Last one was told ""wait till drinks are served!"" Then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it Sir"", that sealed it for us, if that’s the BA response to what’s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate."

At our arrival in Amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at London Heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in Amsterdam, this was 3 days ago and we still don't have the suitcase or any information about it. Today I travelled from Amsterdam to London City Airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when I arrived in London, the suitcase was missing, left in Amsterdam. 2 Suitcases, 2 different flights, they've ruined my holidays. No compensation, no dates on when will I get my property back, no information, lies and more lies.  I was told I could complain online and buy all the things I need, shoes, toiletries, clothes, and I might receive the money back in 30 days! Yes, I might."

Do not be taken in by this marketing con - they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises. Some things just do not change at BA.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nairobi to New York via London,July 2022,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,3.0,1,no,2,"  Customer service is non-existent. For over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks. Nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on BA.com I was flying to Nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly, My sister and husband had tickets on the July 18 from Nairobi to JFK. When BA received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister's ticket, not once but twice. It took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence. My niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times. 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back. The ticket was in premium economy. When I tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. Where is the efficiency? Where is the empathy? Where is the decency? In addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight. Also when I made my reservation, i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a $1400.00 increase. British Airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion. Words simply don't convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company"

If you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone. Or like me you can pre-order weeks before you fly. However there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane, that someone was me it turned out. They also managed to lose my luggage.  I am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it. I will never use them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to Washington via London,July 2022,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line. This ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the UK. "
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Amsterdam via London,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands. Seems British Airways claims & refund process is non responsive, as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation, but received nothing yet. apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight.

Meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley - could they have offered to serve this afterwards? Seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight. Cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldn't sleep even if the seats were comfortable. This was so disrespectful and inconsiderate.
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Reykjavik,May 2022,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,4,yes,5,"  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor."

They were booked many months ago and eligible for the Travel Voucher, so I opted for this online. Since then, absolute silence and BA pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). As a very loyal BA customer for more than 40 years, I am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays. With a further 6 bookings with BA planned for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Toronto,July 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,  Flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down.

Within 24 hours our luggage arrived in Toronto and a wonderful BA representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me. Would definitely give BA a 5 star rating and have them again.

Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight."

My husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight. We were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip (after spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc). When we finally rebooked we still lost one day, one day of lodging, and tickets to a show. We tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us. No one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money. We are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here!"

British Airways has given me such grief, trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away, they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking. It is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight, and I have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours I have spent on hold, or with an agent, being told that my query has been prioritized and that I will receive a call back within 48 hours. I call every 2-3 days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation. I will never book with BA again. Sure, flying with them is easy, but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time. And to think I spent more money on a ticket with BA than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier. BIG MISTAKE"

All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim""). BA doesn't seem to have anything like this. In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag. I hadn't flown BA in many years and with experience I would never book them again."

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Nairobi,June 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight for myself and my wife from Heathrow to Nairobi in Premium Economy using Frequent Flyer points. I then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as I didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles. When I asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation, they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable. I read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats, but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Trieste via Frankfurt,June 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," I used to love this airline and fly LH all the time. What's happened to you, Lufthansa?? The most horrendous customer service, full of misleading information, and no result, in over 6 months! Needed to rebook parents' flights due to my father's medical emergency back in June... called a zillion times, phones constantly disconnecting, three times spoke to a different rep who rebooked for me, three times supposedly booking was confirmed, but then the booking code disappeared from the LH website... I'm beyond appalled!!! What a scam this airline has become!! I kept calling 1800 645 3880, the USA phone number. For weeks, even months, the voice message would say that the lines were busy and to call later. I finally got my call answered in November. I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. I tried the second time. The second rep assisted, I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. Five times in a row! This cannot be normal. At one point, I asked the rep whether they were having issues with phones, and she responded yes, but they are being worked on. But I called on other days, too, and it was the same. I got disconnected every time I got a rep on the phone. Is this a tactic by Lufthansa to keep customers away? Basically you can't get anything solved, since you get disconnected every time!! And I repeat, EVERY TIME!!! Over a span of two weeks, I called the US phone number about 10 times, and got disconnected every time, after I explained to the rep what I needed. So I called the German phone number +49 - 69 - 86 799 799, on December 5, 2022. The rep reviewed the files and offered to rebook my parents' tickets. We spend over an hour on the phone (and got a message from AT&T phone company that I just got charged $200 for the long distance call). The rep gives me a new booking code. She took my credit card number and said I would be charged $41.23 for tax, and $150 for rebooking, for either of my parents. I agreed to these terms. The rep gave me the new booking code. I checked on the website, and the code was on the LH booking site. Two days later I checked again, and the code was no longer there. I called +49 - 69 - 86 799 799 again. Asked a different rep why the code disappeared from the LH website. The rep checked, and said it was because those flights were no longer available (nobody let me know that! Imagine my parents going to the airport on the day of, and find no seats on the plane!). She offered to rebook to ‘available’ dates. Took my credit card information, told me that I would be charged $41.27 for either parent, the booking code would stay the same, and now we’re supposedly confirmed. I received an email from Lufthansa with confirmation. However, the email also said to “Please call back your Lufthansa Service Center”. I smelled a problem again! I called Lufthansa, spoke to a rep, who checked the booking, and she assured me that everything was in order. I also checked the website, and the booking showed. Two days later, IT DISAPPEARED AGAIN! I tried for the last time, on December 21, 2022. The LH rep said that the previous booking didn’t go for ticketing (no explanation provided!). I said this would be my last time attempting to rebook the two flights."

I have been on the phone 20+hours over the last two weeks trying to get a resolution to our missing baggage. We have Apple Air Tags on our bags and have informed them every time of their location. Every time I call I get the same response, the bags made a trip from Munich to Sofia and that's the last it was updated. Every time I tell them the baggages never left Munich and say ""yes the flight was cancelled"" and day they will update the system but I still get the same response every time. We were asked to submit an inventory list to help locate the baggage because apparently GPS trackers aren't relevant enough, and it's been 3 days without a response. This was our first trip for our adoption and the travel was the worst experience either of us has ever had."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Tunis,December 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our flight had a 1 hour delay, which was OK, considering the weather. The captain announced that passengers were free to send messages by the internal Wi-Fi, which was a good attention too. Then things started to get nasty. Late night food was mediocre at best, the omelette was without taste and rock solid. After landing in Tunis at 1:30AM and waiting for the luggage at the delivery, we were informed that ""No luggage has not been embarked in Frankfurt"" ""make the queue to register for lost luggage"". Waited 1 hour in the queue, just to be told that the registration can be made online. No Lufthansa personel on site for any explanation. I was surprised by the lack of sincerity from Lufthansa, the plane captain and crew, since they must have known the missing luggage before the departure but failed to share the information to the passengers.  If I was able to make the online registration in the plane, I could have left immediately the airport! Set aside the general difficulty around the increased air traffic, the lack of sincerity and transparency at Lufthansa has been a real shock; I will have no option but to consider alternatives. After 2 days, our luggages are still missing"
Not Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Munich,December 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Started when our flight was cancelled due to bad weather. The customer service desk at Heathrow T2 had a long line which was expected but after standing in line for 20 minutes all the customer service staff finished their shift, left the desk whilst a 50m long queue of people were waiting. After 2hrs no one had returned back to the desk to serve the customers. After someone asked we were sent to another customer service desk where again the lady behind the counter finished her shift without being replaced leaving customers again standing in queue with no one to help them. On arrival into Munich the following day (we had to pay for our own accomodation in London) 3 of our bags did not arrive. We placed a lost baggage claim at Munich airport but 4 days later we still do not have the luggage back or even an estimated date. I have made several phone calls trying to chase up where our baggage is (snowboard equipment so we have to hire equipment costing us approximately $2000 AUD) and no representative from Lufthansa is willing to assist us in prioritising our baggage to be located. One baggage service representative even hung up on me!! So now we are 4 days without our brand new snowboards, $2500 AUD out of pocket and dismayed and disgusted that an airline can show such absolute disdain to iits passengers! "
✅ Trip Verified ,A220,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Manchester,December 2022,2.0,5.0,3.0,,,3.0,4,yes,8," As with all European Business Class offerings, the seat is nothing special. An economy seat where the middle seat of the three is left empty as a shared space with the other passenger. Lufthansa does offer a meal depending on the time of day it may be hot(ish) or cold. One nice touch is that on many routes a small bar of chocolate and an apple are offered after the meal. Our flight was a little late departing which was frustrating but understandable as the sub-zero temperatures across Europe were causing delays everywhere. Indeed our flight from Budapest had been so late that we only just made this connection. The cabin crew were excellent and the service brisk and professional. All three of our Lufthansa flights this month were excellent when rating the service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hannover to Budapest via Munich ,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Flew, (or at least tried to) with Lufthansa to Budapest. First flight was delayed 2 hours in advance, automatically rebooked to a flight on the same day, 5 hours later. This flight was then delayed two times, half an hour before scheduled departure time with a total of 4 more hours. Missed the connecting flight, and of course the ""help desk"" cannot do anything and a refund or compensation is pure myth."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Florence via Frankfurt,September 2022,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Terrible! Initial flight out was delayed and we would miss our connecting flight so they crammed us onto another flight which also got in late. I had originally paid extra to pick our seats so that was a loss. The entertainment system on the plane was not working so that was also a bust. We arrived so late that we missed our private transport. The return flight was worse and never actually happened!! After waiting at the Florence airport for 7 hours, Lufthansa cancelled our flight out and claimed weather (not sure how it could have been weather since another flight going to the same place, Frankfurt, was allowed to take off). We were now stranded with no one to help us. We were told to go to the customer service desk where we initially checked in for the flight. The rep recommended that we travel to another airport and book a flight out on a different carrier. We did this at great expense to us. We have since asked Lufthansa to reimburse us for the Lufthansa flight that we never took because it was cancelled by Lufthansa. They refused. I never want to fly this airline again. There were cheaper flights available but I chose Lufthansa based upon their rating. What a joke! I flew home on Delta and had a wonderful experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Economy Class,Milano Malpensa to Frankfurt,December 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,4.0,3,yes,10,"  Lufthansa took me from point A to point B, safely and on time. The flight lasted under two hours, and I was surprised that in economy they still gave us bottled water and a little chocolate. The 25 year old plane was very well-kept.  I paid a little bit extra to sit on the 2 seat emergency aisle, and I lucked out because I had no one next to me. If you are a frequent flyer like me I don’t understand what all the negative comments about Lufthansa are all about. They do a fantastic job!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,December 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I have been at Frankfurt airport after traveling on an early morning flight out of Amman which left at 340am their time. I have been up for over 36 hours at this point and my flight has been delayed multiple times. It was originally supposed to leave at 1040 am and now we are looking at 600pm. We are going to Chicago, and from there have a flight to Charlotte, NC before driving 3.5 hours home. This is on top of being told we will be provided a “meal” but being given only trail mix, some kind of chocolate cookie bar, water and juice. We were also loaded onto shuttle buses that had very few seats, we were packed in like sardines, and taken to the tarmac to board a new flight. We watched them load our luggage while we sat stationary on the tarmac with no explanation. Then they started unloading the luggage back off the plane and we began receiving texts that our flight was delayed again until 4pm them immediately received another text stating it was delayed until 6pm. My partner as significant rheumatological health problems and did not have access to a seat, which is a problem for her, and was in tears from standing stationary on a flat hard surface for so long. There was poor air circulation on the shuttle and the close proximity of everyone packed onto the shuttle quickly made it become suffocatingly hot.  We waited approximately 45 minutes on the shuttle in front of the plane before being told, with zero explanation, that we were being taken back to the gate we had just left.  We were then told that our gate was moved from z54 to B23, which is quiet the hike in the airport. This is on top of sleep deprivation and zero real food. I began researching Lufthansa customer rights and found that we are supposed to be provided with a meal voucher to be used at participating restaurants within the airport and that it is built into the bar code of the boarding pass. When we went to use it, the lady at the restaurant said it was something they honor and use but when she scanned the code, she said it hadn’t been activated by the airline yet. When we came back to the counter to see about having it activated, we were told they couldn’t activate it and a manager had to. It is now 408pm local time.  I understand that delays happen but the overall lack of communication and lack of customer service has been appalling. I have never seen this level of lack of caring for the clientele paying for services by a company."

I want to take time here to recognize the excellent job of the cabin crew on the flight, which not only took care of me and provided me with as much comfort as possible but also coordinated everything to make my way to the hospital fast and easy. Luckily I got on time to the hospital and they could treat my issue before it scaled to a more severe situation.

If you are sleeping, then you won't get water or food even if you ask multiple times. I pressed the button and was waiting for 20 mins for a glass of water.  I have traveled a lot but the experience with Lufthansa is painful. I don't think they really have any concerns and if customer experience really matters to them."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Madrid,November 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I felt compelled to write this, even though nothing I am going to describe in my recent travel experience hasn't already been written by others. The only thing I can add is that I am shocked that the Department of Transport in the U.S. and the FAA continue to allow Lufthansa to operate with impunity. I have flown Lufthansa for decades, (because I primarily fly on United, and being the Star Alliance partner, inevitably I would be on Lufthansa in the European portion). This month was the first time I traveled outside of the U.S. since the pandemic. I had heard that Lufthansa has completely fallen off the cliff in terms of service, reliability and even general operational adequacy, but I thought, a short 2 hr flight RT between Frankfurt and Madrid, how bad can that get? Their seats booking system is broken, and while we had paid for premium seats over and over again (and promised previous overcharged payments would be refunded, I don't expect to see that refund), we essentially had no premium seat assignments up to the day of departure. Their ground crew was rude and hostile, (e.g. just did not answer my questions, rolled their eyes and smirked with agents next to them, etc.), and the flight crew basically was not present throughout the flight. No service whatsoever on the flight (no snacks, no drinks, I didn't know this is a discount budget airline?). Mobile boarding pass could not be issued at time of check in, I had to line up at airport, at which point, the agent harassed me by insisting on weighing my carryon (they did not insist on doing that for my husband who is White), and said my carryon was 1 kg over, so I had to check it. At least, my luggage did not get lost. I was horrified by the experience. I sent many letters of complaints to the company, I do not expect anyone to respond or compensate."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Haneda to Munich,November 2022,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,,5.0,4,yes,8,"  The flight experience was very good, far better than expected. Crew friendly, flight on time, food okay if not a little poor, self service of drinks in the galley, movie selection/ entertainment system good: a smooth flight, on par with ANA, which I had flow on the leg Frankfurt-Haneda."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Nice,September 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,1,no,1," We use to love Lufthansa but now it has become the worst airline both on-board and with the worst customer service. No one is ever there to address issues, if they are there they are rude. You can’t talk to a live support. No response to email inquiries. They owe me 250 euros but have not yet reimbursed me. Flight cancellations, delays are very common with no explanation or support. Terrible food on board on international flights. Avoid Lufthansa at any cost."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bologna to Munich,June 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  They won't send me the money they owe me for something that was their fault. In June 2022 their flight from Bologna to Munich was late and caused me to miss the connection to Toronto. I waited in line for 5 hours and was told they ran out of vouchers and would happily reimburse my overnight expenses which amounted to about $300. I'm a college student and could barely afford to cover that, so I've really needed my money back. But after I went through the email-only customer service process, after 2 months the rep asked for my bank information to send me the money - I responded promptly - and never got the money, almost 4 months later. I sent multiple follow up emails and nobody will respond. There's basically no way to contact them otherwise. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,BOG to FRA,November 2022,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,8,  Nice Flight on time in Business through a mileage upgrade. Cabin crew very nice and attending. Food was quite decent three course Menu and breakfast even though the flight was a late night one. Seats are a bit dated. Yes it’s a full flat bed but seat had some male function and needed to be reset. Also the head part is annoying when sleeping. But all in all a good experience.
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Tunis via Frankfurt,November 2022,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,2,"  You get what you pay for. Lufthansa crew are always on point, if a little dull, but the business class product is embarrassing. Chaos at the gates, nasty ground staff, no sense of feeling like this could be a fun trip. The food onboard is poor with a single selection, no charging points, no amenities, no pillow or blanket on a late night flight, no entertainment, no recognition of Miles and More status. Just sub-par on every count except price. Well done for making a cheap product feel really cheap."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Vancouver,November 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,,3.0,2,no,5,"  We paid for premium economy for the transatlantic flight. Weeks before our departure, we paid for seat reservation as we want to ensure we are seated together and have the window/aisle, 2 seats only - so not to sit beside a fellow passenger). We got an email that our carrier will be changed to Eurowing. 24 hours before our flight I did my on line check in, they moved us to the middle aisle with 3 seater. What is the point of paying for seat reservation, and being moved for no reason at all? This is a rip-off in my opinion, paying already for premium seats, and you need to pay for seat selection! Food from Amman to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to Cairo which is over 4 hours, they gave a stale sandwich. Egypt Air for a short haul flight from Cairo to Jordan, at least provided a cold plate , For the amount of money we paid, it was really not worth it!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Keflavík,November 2022,1.0,3.0,3.0,,,2.0,1,no,1,"  Frankfurt to Keflavík, Iceland in Business Class in an A320neo. Lufthansa's Business Class product within Europe is a joke, a glorified Economy Class. The lack of quality is apparent right away during boarding. Priority boarding is virtually non-existent. This time we were herded into a crowded bus and driven to the aircraft on the tarmac. Then the seating - virtually identical to Economy except with a slightly more legroom and the middle seat left unoccupied. Hardly premium. No inflight entertainment nor WiFi on their A320neo aircraft for a flight over over 3 hours. Why does Lufthansa charge Business Class fare only to provide us an Economy Class experience? This is a case of false advertising."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bombay to Frankfurt,November 2022,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4,no,5,"  Bombay to Frankfurt in Business Class in an A340-300. Lufthansa's current fleet to and from Bombay is either the aging A340 or the aging B747-400 aircraft. Both are well past their prime and so is the Business Class seating configuration which is 2-2-2 with no direct aisle access for the passenger by the window. The dated seat design is not in the same class as those offered by rivals such as Qatar, ANA, Singapore Airlines and so on. Where Lufthansa shines is the inflight service which is top notch. The flight attendants are warm and efficient. Currently it is not worth paying for Lufthansa Business Class. The only reason I stick with this airline if the suitability of routing for my needs."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Brussels to Barcelona via Frankfurt,October 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,,,2.0,1,no,2, The flight to Frankfurt is short and the service provided in business is a disaster - I cannot describe an apple and muesli with a small bottle of milk as a decent continental breakfast - I was lucky there was some decent breakfast available in the business lounge in Frankfurt the meal served on the flight to Barcelona was also very mediocre - the inflight service on Lufthansa really is declining heavily : extremely small portions of cheap ingredients like boiled beef - and once again my suitcases did not arrive - the ground handling promised a delivery at my hotel in Barcelona at 5 pm unfortunately it was 1 am during the night - I've had it with Lufthansa
Not Verified ,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to London Heathrow,November 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,2.0,3,no,4,  Emails were sent to check hand luggage into the hold due to amount of person’s using hand luggage. However unlike in London on departure to Munich this was not followed up with mandatory removal of hand luggage by staff. This is all free of charge. As the staff did not force passengers to enter baggage into the hold this created an uneasy attitude towards luggage already in place in overhead storage - this created animosity within the plane and aggressive behaviour. There were numerous bags far too big and heavy into the above lockers. I find this level of incompetence astounding as the first journey was nothing like the incompetence we’ve received on return.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Düsseldorf via Munich,November 2022,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2,no,1,"  One of the worst experiences I ever had on this airline. I booked a flight from Mumbai to Düsseldorf via Munich. A few hours before the flight when I try to check in, I see a notification stating that i cannot go ahead with the check in process and need to select an alternative connection. They rebooked my flight without my consent on one of their star alliances partners at a time which was not at all convenient to me. So i had to go from Mumbai to New Delhi and then from New Delhi to Munich and to Düsseldorf instead of the direct flight from Mumbai to Munich and  to Düsseldorf. Moreover, the flight from Mumbai to Delhi was delayed by up to 3 hours and they lost my luggage between Munich and Düsseldorf. I could not reach the customer care as it was a Sunday and it was out of their working hours. I had to call a separate customer service number who hung up on me on the pretext of clarifying the information"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to  Panama,October 2022,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,4,"  We booked a flexible Premium Economy ticket with Lufthansa from Paris to Bogotá. About three weeks earlier, Lufthansa announced that the long-haul flight from Frankfurt had been cancelled. So I called the call center and asked that Eurowings Discover flies to Bogotá via Panama City. Confirmation etc. received by email. Hotel canceled in Paris. 4 days later this ticket was canceled again by Lufthansa. Another call to the call center revealed that you have to fly from Paris - no customer service from Lufthansa.  They insisted on Paris, and the reference to the new ticket issued and that Lufthansa had canceled it didn't help. Only the internal instructions at Lufthansa were referred to. Transfer to AG from Paris rejected. Either money back or from Paris. Arrival and hotel organized again and then with two changes to Bogotá. You don't have to say a word more about what is called on European routes at LH Service. Eurowings Discover - yes it works, but all drinks in the Premium Eco are free of charge. Otherwise, customer orientation at Lufthansa is underground - even if they cancel flights themselves. Hands off! Wir haben eine flexibles Premium Economy Ticket mit Lufthansa von Paris nach Bogotá gebucht. Ungefähr drei Wochen vorher teilte Lufthansa mit das der Langstreckenflug ab Frankfurt storniert sei. Also das Callcenter angerufen und angesprochen das man mit Eurowings Discover über Panama-Stadt nach Bogotá fliegt. Bestätigung usw. per Email erhalten. Hotel in Paris storniert. 4 Tag später ist dieses Ticket von Lufthansa wieder storniert worden. Ein weiterer Anruf beim Callcenter ergab das man von Paris fliegen muss - Kundenservice gar keiner seitens Lufthansa. Es wurde auf Paris bestanden, auch der Hinweis auf das ausgestellte neue Ticket und das ja von Lufthansa storniert wurde hat nichts geholfen. Es wurde lediglich auf die internen Anweisungen bei Lufthansa verwiesen. Umbuchung auf AG von Paris abgelehnt. Entweder Geld zurück oder ab Paris. Anreise und Hotel wieder organisiert und dann mit zweimal umsteigen nach Bogotá. Über das was sich auf Europastrecke bei LH Service nennt muss man kein Wort mehr verlieren. Eurowings Discover - ja geht, aber n ihr alle Getränke in der Premium Eco kostenfrei. Ansonsten ist die Kundenorientierung bei Lufthansa unterirdisch - auch wenn sie selbst Flüge streichen.

Lufthansa provides an utterly mediocre product on this route. The seating in Business is Economy class-like with the middle seat kept empty and with a little more legroom. No WiFi on this 3+ hours flight. Boarding in Keflavík was a disaster. No separate lane or even allowance for Priority boarding. What is the purpose of spending money on a Business Class ticket if the experience is going to be Economy?
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Mumbai,October 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3,no,7,"  Munich to Mumbai in Business Class in an A350-900. Lufthansa's long haul Business Class product is a mixed bag. With the 2-2-2 seating configuration and the mediocre seats themselves, Lufthansa is way behind the top players in this class. Where Lufthansa shines is the quality of inflight service. This was a comfortable flight but Lufthansa needs to quickly up its hard product game."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Glasgow,September 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I flew from Newark to Glasgow through Frankfurt and my baggage did not make the connecting flight in Frankfurt. It was supposedly put on the same flight the next day, however, I never received it during my entire 9 days in Scotland. I filed a claim for reimbursement of my expenses and was declined because Lufthansa couldn't find a PIR. I provided the baggage claim # from the Glasgow Airport servicing company, Menzies Aviation. I was not advised by Lufthansa or anyone at the Glasgow Airport that I needed to file any other claims or reports. I have emailed Lufthansa at least 4 times since their denial of my claim on 10/03/22 and have received no response. I called Lufthansa customer service and was told that I have to deal with baggage issues by email and there's nobody to speak to regarding the matter. I'm being taken advantage of by an airline and a system that is extremely dysfunctional and unprofessional."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Charlotte via Munich,November 2022,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3,no,5,"  Leg space is pathetic, leg was literally numb on the journey of 10 hours and if someone reclines their seats then we are left with even less leg space. I was in the middle seat and my son is 5ft 10 and he suffered a lot. The second meal provided on the 10 hour flight, the sandwich was extremely pathetic. I couldn't eat even half the sandwich. Veg option was only pasta and it wasn't so great, need to give better meals for sure. Movie selection definitely needs more changes in the regional category."

Their desk staff are rude, lie and totally unhelpful I requested a wheelchair at all legs of my trip, when I arrived in Munich they dropped me at the wrong gate and no one from the carrier was around to help (very poor customer service) The same happened in Frankfurt coming home, total mess up and Lufthansa could care less, just plain out and out lies."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,"Frankfurt, Germany to Cairo, Egypt",October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Business Class on Lufthansa is a “joke” and they shouldn’t be able to advertise or sell it as such! Their front cabin is exactly the same as their second coach cabin. 3 small seats on both sides. Tall people like my husband, are absolutely miserable due to no leg room! We have flown business class on many other airlines, but none with business class like Lufthansa! They leave the middle seat vacant to call it “business class” and that should be labelled as “fraud” in my opinion. The food is deplorable and definitely shouldn’t be consumed! It was an all around horrible experience that I will never have again!!!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-313,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Frankfurt,November 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,1," Lufthansa used to be one of my favorite airlines. The only positive thing is the safety, other than this nothing. I flew on my birthday back home. Nobody congratulated me. The food quality is very bad. LH served us lunch after one hour of flying. The food was too dry as LH have overheated it. Then left us without food and drinks for almost 8 hours, then served breakfast with the most worst sandwich you can eat in your life. If you are hungry during the flight, you need to pay for snacks. They have a Green strategy, but most of the people around me did not finish the sandwich, which as a consequence lead to more waste. Pillows and blankets are very bad quality. The cabinet temperature is very cold. Toilet was not cleaned frequently. I am not speaking about a short flight, it is 10 hours flight. The entertainment options are very poor and they have provided us with low quality headset. In general, avoid it by any means!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Geneva to Hong Kong via Frankfurt,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,2,"  I was flying out of Geneva to NZ, via Frankfurt and HK. From Frankfurt I had a 1 hour - 40 minute stop over to reach my connecting flight to HK. An hour before the flight was due to depart I received an email advising me that my Geneva tō Frankfurt flight was going to be 15 minutes late. 30 minutes later, I received another email advising that the flight would now be an hour delayed. A Lufthansa representative eventually advised the delay due to a ‘technical’ problem, and that ground staff would at Frankfurt would be on hand to help all passengers with late or missed connecting flights. While waiting for our plane to land in Geneva we were told the replacement plane was smaller than the original intended plane, as such, our hand carry luggage would have to be surrendered upon boarding, This created even more delays. 40 minutes into the flight, the pilot announced that due to bad weather, the flight would be now diverted to Nuremberg. At the Nuremberg tarmac, we were given little information. Hours later we were told we would be bussed to Frankfurt, however we were waiting for a bus to arrive, and also, there were no ground crew to help disembark the luggage. Later, we were told to collect our luggage and wait for the bus. No specific area was designated. Eventually an airport representative came out and advised the bus would be arriving in 10 minutes The bus ride would take approximately 2 and a half hours. During this entire 6-7 hour Geneva to Frankfurt ordeal, passengers were not fed nor given time to use the bathroom. During the bus ride I received emails from Lufthansa advising me they had, without consulting me, rebooked the remainder of my trip home. This rebooking meant an entirely different route, and it would also mean I would arrive back in New Zealand a whole day later than I had intended. At Frankfurt we disembarked at a bus stop. No Lufthansa representative was there to greet or advise us. The bus driver simply drive away with no instructions. A majority of the passengers stood around lost and confused. Using my phone Google maps, I began walking terminal 1 at Frankfurt airport. At the terminal, we discovered it largely deserted. Not surprisingly as it was well after midnight. Most check-in counters were closed. Eventually we found some staff who handed every passenger vouchers for 1 night stay at a hotel and two taxi vouchers and told us we had to sort out our problems in the morning. Weather problems aside, if there were no technical problem with Lufthansa's plane to begin with, we would have landed in Frankfurt on schedule and avoided the airport closure due to ‘bad weather’ and I would have made my flight to Hong Kong. Even after the bad weather and plane diversion issue, the lack of support and help from Lufthansa made the bad experience worse. There was no attempt by Lufthansa to help or guide us from Nuremberg to Frankfurt, and there was no help at all once we arrived at Frankfurt. I have since contact Lufthansa Customer Relations, to date my attempts to contact them have been ignored. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Frankfurt,October 2022,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,4,no,4,  Flight on Time. Good legroom in economy. Drawback was that our flight was cancelled before. Then they gave us another ticket which was fine then three days later they told us that this was not allowed and they did a mistake. So we had to go on a long connecting flight to Bogota instead of direct. Flight itself nice. Only booking and call center are totally crazy.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Zadar to Singapore via Frankfurt,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0,2,no,3,"  My flight was from Zadar to Frankfurt and then to Singapore. The flight from Zadar was cancelled after we checked in the bags and just before boarding. No explanation was given. We were automatically re-booked on the same flight 3 days later. That wasn't a problem for us as we are based only 25 minutes from the airport and have our own apartment. However, things could have been much worse. The flight from Frankfurt to Singapore was in an old worn out airplane, with very little leg room. My seat was broken and very uncomfortable. The best they could do was to give me some thick blanket to put under. That made it better, but still not comfortable. The food was the worst I even had on a long flight. First meal was vegetarian ravioli and there was no other choice. When I commented that I am not vegetarian, the flight attendant was very rude, stating that she can only give me what she had. Her delivery was atrocious. The second meal was a very cold and unappealing sandwich. We didn't eat it and had something at Singapore airport instead. We won't be flying Lufthansa again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Prague to Glasgow via Frankfurt,July 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Despite a huge number of negative comments in here, there’s nothing I could reproach to Lufthansa staff, from the whole cabin crew to customer service at FRA airport, they accompanied us on 4 flights (in total) with empathy and highest degree of professionalism. Our return flight from Scotland was cancelled from FRA to Prg, but everything was so well organized at FRA airport despite covid shortages, everyone queuing was given snacks and a drink, then we were automatically given meal & hotel and taxi vouchers when waiting at a hotel for a new flight the next day. This month (October), I finally received a compensation of 250€ per person. (3 persons in total) with excuses for a cancelled flight. Since we traveled in Economy class, we bought awesome fresh ground coffee, a sandwich and Poke bowl, together for 20€. All the food and coffee was super fresh, very quality and tasty, just like the quality I prepare myself home. Definitely worth money. I think Lufthansa offers outstanding quality when it comes to meals. Ecology and sustainability in Lufthansa catering are a big  highlight to me compared to other airlines. I was scared of flying this summer due to covid shortages all around Europe, but thanks to the Lufthansa excellent team it has been a truly pleasant experience. "

The attendants were spot on, and the aircraft was impeccable, didn't find a single flaw. As a connection flight, even the airports have smoking lounges and are perfectly clean with very little smell. I will definitely will fly with Lufthansa from now on."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Istanbul to Lisbon via Frankfurt,October 2022,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3," This company provides an amazing experience: at one hand, it’s one of the most expensive airlines, on the other hand, 70% (3 of 4 for last week) of my flights with them were delayed, and any person in the whole team didn’t even tried to tell the passengers why we are waiting at the gate, then waiting on a board. No service that is expected for that cost, no communications, the most expensive delays (I’ve been paying for the timing that is perfect for me: if I’m agree with possible delays, I prefer to spend less money and get on a low-cost flight). Total disappointment."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Zurich to Dubai via Frankfurt,September 2022,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3,no,3," There was a time when I loved Lufthansa, but not anymore. Two flights to Dubai, both cancelled. Arrived at destination over 8 hours later, no hotel offered. Airline downgraded me to a lower class, contacted the airline for a compensation for cancelled flights, the airline refused to pay compensation without stating the reason."

Not Verified ,Embraer,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London City to Frankfurt,October 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa cancelled my flight from London City to Frankfurt after the scheduled departure time, then booked me on another flight eight hours later. There was no explanation for the cancellation, and a £10 food voucher was hardly compensation. (For a connecting flight from Frankfurt to Zagreb, they rebooked me on three-star Croatia Air.) I lost the first day of a three-day stay in Zagreb, finally reaching my hotel late at night. Incidentally, my return flight to London City on Swissair was infinitely better in terms of food, drink and comfort. I've given Lufthansa the benefit of the doubt up to now, but shall try to avoid in future."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Ahmedabad via Frankfurt,July 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," 3 tickets booked for 3 passengers to fly in December 2022, are for round trip flights booked well over a year in advance for international travel for our daughter's wedding. Since the booking was made, there have been countless flight and schedule changes requiring us to repeatedly contact customer service to accept changes and/or find alternatives as proposed by the agents and re-book on alternate flights with different airlines, timings, dates, airports etc. Despite the extensive flexibility on our end in terms of these factors, every time we called and confirmed a booking with an agent, we were left to find that the booking had either not been made, changed again, or entirely cancelled. We have evidence documenting the numerous calls lasting over 50 hours in total, as well as all the emails/screenshots of bookings from the website documenting the booking changes, as well as the flight cancellations that were made without our knowledge and were not informed of until checking ourselves. At this time, despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue, the itineraries are missing components of the journey as originally booked ie. the last leg of the trip from DEL - AMD for record locators #1 & 2. The customer service agents have not been able to resolve this and have pretty much said there is nothing they can do in terms of ensuring we have confirmed flights for the entire trip as planned and have left us hanging, without answers, and in a panic as our travel date approaches. I also intend to submit a compensation request as advised by an agent in order to be compensated for the price paid for the flights at the time of booking as well as the additional fare difference to book on ticket now with a different carrier, and making the same request to management if they are unable to resolve our problem internally, by booking us on appropriate Lufthansa/Partner flights as booked and paid for."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Orlando,October 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,8," My husband and I were returning home from a long Europe vacation. We were able to check-in online and ticket counter personnel was nice and professional. Once on board we were greeted by the staff who was extremely cordial and professional with all of us (22 people on the upper deck of the 747-400). The 3 course lunch and the cold dinner we were served were very good, actually one of the best we had eaten on a plane, as well as the wines we selected with every dish. The crew made sure we were all, 22 of us, taking care of and feeling as special passengers. The attention to details that this airline's employees offered us was very much welcomed and appreciated. During the flight, 10 hours in total, we were offered beverages, sweet and salty snacks, and anything else we desired. Once we arrived, the ground personnel advised us that one of our luggage was left in Frankfurt. We filled the paper work to claim for the luggage. When we got home around 9 pm, we received an email confirming that our claim was entered into their system. The luggage arrived 36 hours after we landed."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Singapore,October 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2,no,5,"  Very inefficient. Unable to check in online like a lot of other passengers because their system is unable to verify the docs. No choice but to queue for manual check in which took almost an hour. The food is disappointing too. I opted for low sodium meal. For dinner I was given brown rice with chicken in some salty sauce. And for breakfast, I was given a very sad sandwich, first layer with cucumber, second later with tomato. Also, because I took Lufthansa, I had a stopover at Frankfurt where airport staff are rude and very inflexible. No assistance given to passengers who are about to miss their next flight whatsoever."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Graz via Munich,June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I traveled for business with Lufthansa from London in the UK to Graz in Austria over the summer. Upon my return, Lufthansa canceled my connecting flight to Munich. They did not offer any rerouting, were not reachable by email or phone and lost my time and over 600 EUR since I needed to rebook on my own and to spent an additional night in Graz. It was an altogether horrific journey since I was pregnant. In correspondence I've had subsequently with Lufthansa trying to invoke my passenger's rights under the EU Passenger Rights regulation, Lufthansa's customer service was disrespectful and rude. No refund was issued."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rio de Janeiro to Berlin via Munich,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  This company's customer service is simply unacceptable. I arrived in Berlin six days ago with no luggage. I'm following the instructions given at the airport (to check the website in order to track my luggage), the website says that my luggage was already delivered which is not true. When I call the airline to find out what is going on they say the delivery company CLS is responsible for the service and they can't do anything but give me a phone number so I can call and sort it myself. How come? I paid for the Lufthansa ticket, I checked the bag at the Lufthansa counter, I visit the Lufthansa website to trace the baggage and they are not responsible? Not mention my flight was 7 hours delayed and my connection flight in Munich was overbooked. Negligence, irresponsibility, lack of sensitivity to passengers! Just a horrible experience since."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Tokyo,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,2,"  Seat space: half. Check in: procedure: non existing. Information about delay: non existing (I got three mails after our arrival in Japan!). Aircraft: Boeing 747-8. The cabin crew turned up just 3 times during a 14-hour-flight, clearly showing that their passengers were a nuisance to them. My meals a real catastrophe - dinner consisted of a pasta dish, breakfast a slice of bread topped with ?. Luggage with priority tags: one piece arrived fairly early, two pieces shortly before the belt was stopped. Overall experience: non existing."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Frankfurt,August 2022,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They lost my baggage and demonstrated an appalling attitude throughout the course of handling the issue. Having closed my missing baggage claim without my having received my baggage yet, they still have not updated me as to the whereabouts of my baggage. I flew with them back in August 2022. At the time of writing, it is mid-October 2022. Things happen. I get it. What really matters is its resolution. Lufthansa seems to me as if they don't really care about what their customers think. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bogota to Frankfurt,October 2022,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our flight left 2 hours late. While waiting in Bogota we didn't receive any information what was going on. There were 100 people who were left behind at the airport because of the weight of the plane. They had to take another flight. We were lucky to get on the plane. When we arrived in Frankfurt we waited more than 1 hour on our luggage. Nobody knew how long it would take. They even left some of the peoples luggages in Bogota. It was a really bad experience with a long time of waiting. Lucky, the staff on the plane was very kind. That was the only positive aspect."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sao Paulo to Amsterdam via Frankfurt,October 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,1.0,4,yes,6,"  All was pretty fine, apart from the fact that in the flight back, one of my suitcases was not loaded inside the airplane from FRA to AMS. It has been a month already and it is still sitting inside a warehouse in AMS. I know this because I put an Airtag inside of the suitcase and can track it. Lufthansa claims that ""they have been unable to contact the company that handles bags for them in Amsterdam because they don't answer phone or email"", which is untrue and makes it look even worse for LH. The lack of action and transparency is pretty frustrating. Other than that, the flight itself was good, the outdated C cabin is not very private but surprisingly comfortable, food was pretty good and crew was nice. Also in the outbound leg, the B748 was changed last minute to a B744, which was (at least for me) pretty nice because I had never flown in one. That said, my seat was not changed and I got to still sit in the upper deck. Many people were not so fortunate and this caused quite a bit of a commotion on ground."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo to Munich ,October 2022,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,1,"  Currently flying from HND to MUC is a long trip as flights avoid Russian airspace, approximately 14hrs, or in my case 14hrs of looking at stained plastics, a clicking headset and having to push the tv screen back into place as it works itself free every half hour. Schedule changes feel very much the norm in today's travel however, I would have hoped the passenger log for my flight would have been correct. Shortly after take off the lead member of the cabin crew took his time to introduce himself to some of the passengers with some polite chat. At this point it became apparent, despite checking in 12 hrs earlier the passenger log had no idea who I was. Asked if I was someone I wasn't, an accusing ""have you changed seats"" was delivered followed by the non reassuring ""oh, no don't worry"" and a clear tone of 'your not at a high enough loyalty member to warrant my time' was delivered in a closing remark. It should be easy for the cabin crew to tell the truth, so when during the second meal service I was informed that the first option was no longer available I was surprised to see the opposite row still able to order and receive, with the polite question asking if option 1 was actually available my original meal choice was found. I can't help thinking Lufthansa have stripped all customer service out of their operation, several attempts to contact the team before the flight were ignored, the only engagement came when they cancelled a section of the journey and asked me to call them, nice touch that their automatic email pretends they have tried to contact me. A small connection flight cancellation was apparently enough to confuse the booking system and the many people in the call centre.  It took six hours of my time reviewing the Lufthansa schedule and and their ticketing availability to find a route that the 'system' would allow. To rub salt into the wound, at HND I was approached by an agent for Lufthansa and asked if I would like to change flights,  for one of the routes I had been denied and that had always shown availability. This is not helpful one hour out when I had arranged business calls around the terrible schedule Lufthansa and landed me with."
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Istanbul via Frankfurt,October 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa by far is one of the worse airlines today. I made a change to my business class air ticket on phone with a Lufthansa representative and got his confirmation and paid him online. The change happened 10 days before the departure. On the day of departure, the counter person told me the Lufthansa had done something wrong and I have to pay $1,700 in order to take the flight. I was shocked and so upset, it took over an hour to have someone on the phone to admit that the problem has been created from their side. However, this was 30 mins before the departure so I barely made it to the flight. I arrived in Istanbul on Oct 12th at 5pm, and I have not yet received my luggage, and it’s been 52 hours since I arrived. I’m so disgusted with the level of unprofessionalism that Lufthansa has demonstrated from booking, online services, checking in, airplane, their cabin service and low quality and quantity of food. Remember, I had a business class ticket, not sure how messed up the economy tickets have been."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Sao Paulo via Frankfurt,September 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,4,yes,8," First and most of all, Lufthansa brought me and my luggage to my destination on time and without any hassle, I think that's fair enough to mention these days. Furthermore, the flight was surprisingly pleasant and comfortable, and good service was provided, despite being fully booked. Lufthansa might not be as fancy as Qatar or Singapore, but both dinner and breakfast were decent and drinks were filled up frequently. While the seating arrangement in 2-2-2 is not the latest standard for business class, I found the seat comfortable enough for 11 hours. On these really long flights, Lufthansa now provides extra padding for the seat to sleep on and a sleeping shirt. The only drawback is the entertainment program, there used to be a better selection of movies, and the music selection is really poor, obviously that's the field to cut costs now. Cabin crew did their job in a friendly and professional way, not more, not less."
✅ Trip Verified ,A359,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dusseldorf to Singapore via Munich ,October 2022,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  We had paid for economy seats; my wife went online and reserved aisle seats. She selected seats in a row that was about halfway between the mid and rear toilet areas. (Around row 40) When we arrived at the departure lounge at Munich there was some sort of loud-speaker bargaining situation going on. The Lufthansa staff clerk was stating that a woman in Business class had her seating booking messed up and as such she was going to be separated from her two kids. The clerk was asking for volunteers to give up their seat in order for the woman and her kids to be together. The suggestion was, that the flight wasn't happening until this seat problem was settled. After some time, a guy volunteered to a round of applause from the rest of the people being held up. When we got on board, I got to the row that was printed on my boarding pass that I had been given when we checked our bags earlier in the day. I hadn't checked if the seat matched my wife's online booking from the previous day. When I got to the row shown on my pass, there was a guy sitting on the aisle in what I thought was mine or my wife's seat. A short argument ensued until the guy pointed out the seat next to the window matched my boarding pass. Some people in seats in front of us turned and said they have messed up all the seats. The seats my wife and I endured for 12 hours were right in front of the toilets with little or no movement of our seats or chance to get out without climbing over the lucky winner of the aisle seat. The seats were in a row that was roughly 20 rows different to the one we'd booked. There was no acknowledgement or apology from staff. We noted that the crew were absent from the end of the aisle to welcome passengers to Singapore. Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Brisbane was the third and last leg of our journey, an approximately 8-hour flight. We had tried to once again book our seats online, but the airline was trying to charge $20 dollars for the privilege. So, we just indicated that we'd prefer aisle seats. We received our boarding pass and we'd been given aisle seats in different rows. My wife in the row that is normally reserved for parents with babies and the row immediately behind. When we arrived on board, of course there was a woman with a <1yo baby breast feeding in the adjoining seat. The parents did their best but the crying and continuous getting up and down to silence the baby made sleep impossible for anyone nearby. Cabin staff were noticeably absent in assisting the parents. Avoid Lufthansa at all costs in future."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Billund to Seoul via Munich,October 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My first flight was delayed an hour and 15 minutes and as the transfer time in Munich was only scheduled for 40 minutes I missed my direct flight to Seoul. I was then rebooked for another flight 6 hours later from Munich to Singapore with a 7 hour layover to Seoul. The reason I booked Lufthansa in the first place was to get the direct flight from Europe. But apparently there was not even one seat available on the direct route the day after. I could have stayed at an airport hotel and Lufthansa could have at least guaranteed me a somewhat comfortable sleep as compensation for their delay, but instead I get to spend the night on my way to Singapore and a day at the airport, already tired from the long extra wait, not even to mention missing my meetings in Seoul that I had planned. When I booked my original ticket I had paid extra for window seats, but as the window seats were already fully booked I got an aisle seat and when I asked if I could at least be upgraded for the inconvenience I was told that it would be on my own expense. As I will be almost 24 hours delayed I thought as it states on the Lufthansa website, that I would get the necessary care during the redirecting, but all I got was a 15 euro voucher (which had to be spent all at once) in one of the airport restaurants. Sadly most meals start at 20 euros so it should rather be called a modest meal contribution instead. Very sad to have around 24 hours longer to spend in airport transfer with a 15 euro “meal” voucher, aisle seats despite having already paid for window seats and a service level below minimum. Sad experience with Lufthansa today. Cannot recommend to anyone."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Venice to San Francisco via Munich,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1," This is the worst company to fly with. We flew it coming here because my husband is European and he believed Lufthansa was a good airline. We first took it from SFO and the first problem was they made us pay for luggage even though I showed the agent that our ticket included 1 checked luggage. I always pay for luggage beforehand because it’s a lot cheaper than what they make you pay at the airport. He made us pay $75 anyways. This rubbed me the wrong way but I went on with the vacation. Of course my husband wanted to use them going back to SFO so we did. First, they left late so the plane was delayed and we missed our connection. We tried to run and make it but were held up in Germany because the lady was upset that she couldn’t find a stamp in my passport even though I kept telling her I have a residency card for Italy so I don't get a stamp. We missed our connection and then had to deal with customer service from hell at Lufthansa. They guy was unbelievably rude. I first asked him if there was another, earlier flight he could put us on so that we wouldn’t have to sit at the airport for like 5 hours. He said no. I asked him if there was a customer service centre and I guess that made him mad because from there he became rude. He told us that we didn’t even pay that much for our ticket and it wasn’t ‘that bad’ and I should be fine with it because it’s not like I’ve never had a delayed flight before. He continued on being rude. I think customer service is definitely the wrong profession for him. I have never ever had to deal with someone like him and I’ve been flying all over the world since I was a teenager. We missed our connection because of their mistakes and instead of being empathetic and kind, he was the opposite. Absolutely despicable. I will never ever fly this airline again. To top it off, he gave us seats that weren’t next to each other for an 11 hour flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham  Frankfurt,May 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Horrendous airline, I hate dealing with them. I have no alternative with the route, visas etc, but every time we have problems. If it's not baggage, it's ticket reissues, they take the money then don't update the system, tickets confirmed so you think it's all ok, don't be fooled this is Lufthansa! your then invited to check in, and you can't sue to the departure time, but it's within 24 hours and your wife's checked in fine. So you call, and your waiting for 48 minutes, then another 42 mins to sort it out. Even after your told it's done, DO not trust it. I've had the same thing on every single booking I've had to change dates for, they are horrific. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Buenos Aires to Oslo via Frankfurt,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," Worst airline ever. Rude, mean and passive aggressive. Flight was delayed six hours and all restaurants at the airport were full. Staff would only allow us into the lounge if we paid. Miles and More does not give you any benefits ever. Login at Lufthansa is almost impossible. Flight attendants are rude. Staff at the airports are rude. Customer service is incompetent, and you risk making matters worse if you call to ask for help (I asked for a simple confirmation of the names on the tickets and three times in a row they sent me a confirmation that only half our group was traveling). Horrible. Will never use again. Not recommended."
Not Verified ,A340,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Singapore via Frankfurt,September 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  LHR-Frankfurt was 90 minutes late leading to a two hour hour connection reduced to 30 minutes to get from plane to gate - found the cabin manager a bit unprofessional at times. After a 1km sprint across frankfurt, made the gate for the next departure to Singapore in a pretty dated plane. Seats were uncomfortable with not a lot of space and the inflight was a big let down. The crew were absent after first meal to 1 hour before landing with zero refreshments inbetween - not even any water or juice, you had to make your way to the back of the plane and pay for it. The food was possibly the worst plane meal I've ever been served, with no option - just vegetarian mushroom stew.. With no other option I had to make do with buying a tube of pringles and a twix to last 11 hours until the cheese sandwich for breakfast. Having set in various stress positions for 12.5 hours, I was relieved to get off with the dreaded fear of having to return on the same airline. Expected so much more - I'll stick with BA for future."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Economy Class,Oslo to Frankfurt,October 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1,no,2," Lufthansa is by far the worst airline in Europe. Over a period of 1 year (I unfortunately fly often with LH as I live in FRA), I have experienced: - 2 flight cancellations - 6 flight delays - 1 overbooking issue. Not only that, but it is the only airline in the world that charges 850€ for a FRA-LON flight, and makes you buy your soda. The seat pitch in economy is the shortest of any airline (Ryanair is comfortable in comparison). In transatlantic flights, they only serve vegetarian food in both meals. Finally the service on ground and on deck is lacklustre. If you can avoid, please do."

Family of 6 with a baby and 3 small children, midnight, no luggage or pram - as they refused to off load, all Lufthansa hotels were full to sleep over. Were told to find own accommodation and airline will refund. Ended up having to fly via Angola instead of direct, which was also delayed for several hours. Was told would not get bassinet and extra leg room (we paid for - as flying with baby and 3 small children) stroller went missing on arrival in Johannesburg! And worst part is still waiting for our accommodation refund despite various phone calls, emails etc to Lufthansa. Despite being told reimbursement will occur. It's been 4 months. Worst customer care. No service. Despite full responsibility and blame lying with Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Miami via Munich & Frankfurt,September 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1,no,1," Athens to Miami via Munich & Frankfurt. Had to pay an extra $200 for my carry-on when they had said it was free first. Again the couple flying with me had the same luggage and paid nothing. The seat for 10hr flight was super tight and uncomfortable. We had 2 layovers with no time to even go to the restroom or anything cause they leave you at a gate and you layover flight is at the other end of the airport so you have to run to get there on time, so I was unable to get anything to eat. The food on the plane was horrible, they only had vegetarian food - no choice. I don't eat vegetables so all in had to eat in the 10hr flight was a piece of stiff cold bread with a little butter and a sip of Sprite. I will never fly the airline again."

Got myself one of the best seats available on LH’s A321 (11A/B/C) with really has lots of space and I enjoyed the ride. Of course we are miles away of what LH’s cabin service used to be, but we got a little bottle of water and a small chocolate. Nice feature was one could follow the route on an own device when connecting (without buying) to the onboard WiFi system. All ok for such short flight. Most important, I safely got at destination."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Hamburg to Munich,September 2022,1.0,5.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,3," Hamburg to Munich. This Business Class trip was in two points worse than before. In Hamburg, no fast lane was available at the security control. The queue was too long, given the booking of a full fare premium product at a premium carrier. The second point was meal service. It consisted of cheese cake only (see picture) - cost cutting has reached the bottom. I feel sorry for the staff, who have to deliver this terrible level of service to Business Class customers. From now on, Lufthansa Business Class stopped to be an option for me, as German Railways ICE 1st Class product is in every point superior - and much cheaper."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Muscat via Munich,August 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,2,"  Not a good experience all round with Lufthansa. I thought it was supposed to be a reputable airline but the service provided to us after we missed our connection in Munich (at the fault of the airline) was extremely poor, and frankly embarrassing for a member of Star Alliance. First, the positives. They automatically booked us on the next flight once our connection had been missed, although this sadly did involve another connection in Frankfurt. Also our baggage did not get lost. So they do get 2/10 for these 2 positives. So, what went wrong? Inconveniently, there was not a single member of Lufthansa staff available at the airport in Munich. Thankfully we had downloaded the Lufthansa app, which seemed to be the only way of accessing the information of the new itinerary. Customers who did not have the app really struggled to find the information as there was no email or SMS communication. EU passenger rights say that the airline is obliged to provide hotel accommodation if the delay is overnight. However, we were told by the cabin crew during the descent that we had to book our own accommodation and then ""send them the bill"". We took the alternative option of staying in the airport, as there was only an 8 hour gap before the new flight to Frankfurt departed. Having to spend a night in Munich airport with our 2 year old was not the greatest experience. The food that Lufthansa provided was frankly shocking. Crisps, chocolate biscuit bars and sugary drinks do not constitute a meal, and this disappointment came after no complimentary food was served on the flight into Munich. All the restaurants, cafes and shops in the airport were closed, so we went without an evening meal that day. Lufthansa did provide blankets and pillows, and then we set about trying to find a place to sleep. The designated sleeping area clearly had not been cleaned. There were only 4 private pods which were all taken, so we ended up with a majorly uncomfortable night on the floor of the airport. Perhaps this is not necessarily the fault of Lufthansa, but if they are not going to book hotels for passengers then they should at least make sure the airport sleeping areas are clean. The next morning we boarded our new flight to Frankfurt at 6am. On arrival, I searched out the Lufthansa service desk to make a complaint, but again found an empty desk. Most disappointingly, we were not able to speak to a member of Lufthansa staff that could help during the entire journey. They did sent a breakfast voucher via email, however the voucher was not accepted by the cafe closest to our gate for Muscat, so that meant spending an extra €17 for breakfast for the 3 of us. No further dramas onward to Muscat, however this flight was with a partner airline. It has been over a month since the flight and still no correspondence from Lufthansa regarding the compensation that we are entitled to by law. The only communication we've had was an email telling us to confirm our new itinerary (sent 2 days AFTER we arrived) and an automated email in response to my complaint, which asked me to submit my flight details (which I had already done 3 times by this point). This experience is in stark contrast to a previous experience with KLM, travelling to Dubai via Amsterdam, where we were given the compensation in cash at the service desk, and there was a driver waiting outside to take us to a hotel for the night. We have no desire to travel again with Lufthansa."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Mexico City to Munich via Frankfurt,September 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa made my trip a living hell. I was in for a very important business meeting in Germany. Not only did they lose my luggage with all my valuable things, they made me lose my meetings, because I had nothing to wear. The people from Customer Service and lost luggage where rude, badly mannered. They claim they will pay for clothes, but they really throw difficult procedures which you will end up not paying you for any reimbursement. It is the worst airline in the world, they left me for a week in Europe without any clothes or luggage."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Barcelona via Frankfurt,September 2022,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Horrible transit organization in Frankfurt airport and Lufthansa. It takes more than 90 minutes to pass all baggage checks and passport control and finaly I missed my flight. I will never use this airport and I will try to avoid Lufthansa as much as I can. If you will have flights outside EU frew Frankfurt airport I recommend to take minimum 140-150 minutes time between flights. Now I received new ticket and need to wait for 2 more hours, also service women didn't believed me that I spent all this time in lines and try to blame me for that."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Glasgow to Atlanta via Frankfurt,September 2022,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We flew our group of six with Lufthansa to Scotland without any delays or difficulties. When we checked in to return home, one of our group members was stopped because her maiden name was on her passport and her married name was on her ticket. Our booking agency, the check in counter, and the Lufthansa customer service line would not assist us with a name correction. We had been first in line at check-in, and went back and forth with the representatives for Lufthansa until we had less than an hour til our flight would take off. We were told we had to buy a $3500 ticket. When we attempted to, the airline couldn't verify our information and rejected the purchase. A supervisor for Lufthansa overrode the restrictions and let our last group member through. We made it to our gate and when we went to board the plane, all our tickets were denied. The same supervisor was at the gate and told us our booking agent had canceled all our tickets without authorization. We called the booking agent who said our tickets were still all confirmed from their end. Then we called the Lufthansa customer support representative who we had talked with earlier. She told us someone at the Glasgow Airport had canceled our group and given away our tickets for both flights of our trip home. We were told we would have to buy six new tickets for a later flight. The gate closed but by some miracle, the pilot heard what had happened and let our group on the plane because we had confirmation numbers, boarding passes, and passports. We encountered the same probably at our layover in Frankfurt. At a small security checkpoint, all our boarding passes were flagged. At the gate, the representative told us our flights had been canceled and given away. She seemed unsurprised at the predicament as if Lufthansa had caused similar issues before and assured us she would do her best to get us on the flight home. We were all able to return home on standby. When we arrived in Atlanta, Lufthansa had lost all of our bags. We cannot recommend Lufthansa and will not be using their services in the future."

The seats in premium economy were most uncomfortable. There was little to no padding, they were old and worn, and the footrest only went to my mid calf. I'm 6'0 tall, so not even overly tall, these were made for little people I think. The food was so-so, nothing special. The stewards had little to no customer service skills, very abrupt and to the point. The in-flight entertainment screen forces you to buy the wifi service to connect your phone with the app to the TV. No option to just connect personal headphones with Bluetooth, very disappointing."

They moved our bag packs from the upper bin and displaced them somewhere else without telling us which caused us to panic thinking that someone had taken our bags with all of our personal belongings in them. No apology was offered whatsoever. When I asked for an explanation, one of the flight attendants sarcastically said, “you found your bags right?” It’s safe to say that we will not be flying with them again."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Newark,September 2022,2.0,3.0,4.0,,1.0,4.0,3,no,7,"  After most recently having flown Polaris class on United and the business class on Air Canada, The flight on a 747 Lufthansa in business class was disappointing. We understand that sometimes when there is the third class, the first class, they have to downgrade the business class. But I guess this might just be an older plane and the seats were tight, and there was no storage space or little cubbies. I’m not even a tall person and I found the seats to be less than well padded. The food service was okay, but it was served off of trolleys like you were in coach. We haven’t seen anything like this in another business class. And, they didn’t give an amenity kits. When we went to the lavatories, we saw offerings of masks and razors and earplugs, but nobody told us about them, And some items were already empty. When you’re paying for business class, you really should get an amenity kit. Even if it’s not the best one in the world. The minimal amount they’re saving, that’s really shameful. Also, they didn’t offer us bottled water until we got off the plane. And the flight that was seven hours to eight hours long, they really should give you a bottle of water if you’re going to take a nap so you can take sips as you need it. One more thing, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working at all. I definitely would not fly Lufthansa for a transatlantic flight again."

✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Tel Aviv via Frankfurt,August 2022,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2,yes,4,"  I booked this flight via Brussels Airlines, so this was codeshare. The first leg from Brussels to Frankfurt was Okay, I do not remember anything extraordinary about it, it was a short 40 minute flight in a regular plane with a regular very-short-haul experience. The second leg from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv was rather odd. We had a connection of 2.5 hours. When we landed in Frankfurt on time the screens showed us the flight was already boarding, which we found to be very weird. We sprinted to the gate, through connection security and passport control, and were devastated to discover that apparently, Israel has special travel regulations that make all flights landing to Israel go through a special process. Our gate was separated from all other gates, it had extra security and when we passed it we saw there is no plane even at the gate. So after security we were essentially locked in a gate that had only one super-over-priced store selling basic literature and food. We waited for 90 minutes until boarding started. When we sat in the plane the pilot announced that our plane ""has the wrong wheels"" and that it would take us 3 hours to replace all the wheels of the aircraft. All passengers were angry. After 40 minutes the captain announced that we will be brought back to the gate, and transferred to a different aircraft. After an hour buses were organized to the new airplane, same model, A321. Once we arrived there were a few dramas involving passengers that were mad that because the configuration was a bit different in the new plane, couldn't seat next to their loved ones. After an intervention of the German police we took off. The crew was excellent, especially A Stadelmann, who although being very tired as we did, did her best and gave an excellent service. At turbulence when I panicked she noticed and calmed me, we had a quick chat and all in all she was very welcoming, using words like ""dear"" to make me feel warm and welcome aboard the plane. The flight was regular, there was no entertainment, and complimentary soft drinks and disgusting sandwiches were given. We landed in a delay of almost three hours, the flight after the drama went perfectly fine. Lufthansa should check her planes twice before almost letting passengers fly in them! I would fly Lufthansa again to make my up my opinion about them fairly."

Fast forward to August 24th 2022, I flew again with them, same old horrible food from Frankfurt to Lagos.

Seats are uncomfortable, narrow and minimal legroom. The food is disgusting and only one option, vegetarian. We were served a pasta in greasy cheese and tomato sauce, served with bland hard vegetables with an odd tasting brownie for dessert. Breakfast was a dry roll with a bit of salad and salmon paste, an orange flavored breakfast roll and a bit of muesli dropped on 2 spoonfuls of yogurt. Coffee is served with your meal not afterwards. Meal is served and drink options arrived 10 mins after your food. No menu options at all, it’s vegetarian or do without. The entertainment system on our return flight was faulty and just a handful of movies and tv were available. Our luggage was left on the runway at Frankfurt in heavy rain and all our clothes were soaking wet. We won’t be flying with Lufthansa ever again and you are advised to save your money and avoid them."

I addressed her as “MAM” to request but her response was “I can’t do anything for you now” rudely. She never approached me again as to why I was calling her. I had to bear the immense pain while taking off and landing. While serving the food she almost insulted me when I asked her if this food contains any kind of meat as she served the food without notifying us veg or non veg.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Munich,September 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,  This is the worst international airline I have ever flown. We purchased Economy class for free luggage. Leaving the states they accepted the Economy but overseas it all of a sudden turned into Economy light. Even with proof of purchase they argued with me and refused to accept the receipt of purchase. They then refused check in and changed our seats from the front to the back. For 24hr the website cancelled our check in and then continued to force more money out of us. The planes are in the worst condition the food is horrible and the staff is not friendly. I will continue to write proper reviews so more people realize this company is fraudulent. I will be contacting them upon return to the states.

My luggage never arrived to Tel Aviv from Munich on Thursday September 8, today its September 11 and am flying back and my luggage is still not found, there is no information and so called hotlines are served by not knowledgeable people who knows as much as the computer screen I look at.

We flew Lufthansa for the majority of our connecting flights to and from Istanbul. We were very disappointed in the level of service for many reasons. First and foremost, we discovered (and were never notified of) the fact that our layover times had been changed so significantly that we found ourselves on the return trip sprinting for our gate each time. Secondly, the quality of the airplanes left a lot to be desired: they were creaky, cramped, the seats had minimal cushioning, and they lacked proper ventilation. The plane on the international leg of return trip was so unbearably hot, we couldn't sleep or get comfortable at all. Thirdly, the quality of the food was horrible - you were given only one option vegetarian pasta for dinner and a dry, horrible tasting vegetarian sandwich for the other. I cannot understand how this airline is rated as 4 stars! This airline does not bill itself as budget, but the service is worse than what other budget airlines offer. I will do everything possible to not fly Lufthansa ever again."

As an example once you had coffee during meal, they won’t give you anything if you ask for it later on. Most of front screens were not functioning. "

I have flown Lufthansa a few times before and I do not remember it being this bad. From the inedible food, to the lack of service, I will not fly again or recommend it to anyone for a Business Class experience. The food all around was bad, they didn't have the type of liquors listed in the menu, the inflight wifi was spotty or didn't work. On top of all of this, the flight attendants are some of the worst I remember and they still have a mask mandate. All reasons to avoid Lufthansa completely!"
