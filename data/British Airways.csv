✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Palma de Mallorca via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,3,no,3,"  I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden. "
Not Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Paris,November 2022,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4,yes,7,"  The plane was nice. IFE was pretty good. The main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag. The staff in the plane from Chicago to Paris was not very friendly. The staff in the way back from Paris to Chicago was very kind and helpful. Big difference. Lastly, my checked bag didn't make it to Chicago. The staff at Chicago didn't really want to help me. One spent a few moments trying to register a claim, gave up, handed me a card with instructions and walked away. I tried someone else about 15 minutes later, while she was not happy to help, she did complete the claim for me which I appreciated. The bag was delivered to my door, 200 miles from the airport, the next day was was great. I would fly Air France again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manchester to Bangkok via Paris ,November 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  The Manchester to Paris segment was very average with a very poor seat pitch but for a 1hr 20 min flight I could grin and bear it. However the Paris to Bangkok segment was excellent on all counts. The service provided by Aurelie Luche was outstanding, professional and ever so efficient and friendly. The food for the 11hour and twenty minute flight was plentiful and tasty. The overall comfort of the seat was not that outstanding but I have to say that what was my first flight with Air France it certainly won't be my last. Well done to the crew, especially to Aurelie."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200ER,Business,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,November 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5,yes,10,"  Glitch with agent put me in regular window seat, instead of paid exit row. Although plane was near capacity, flight attendant went to great lengths to find me an aisle seat and overhead space for camera equipment. Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row. The pair retails for $250! I thanked her profusely, and offered to send her a photo gift. I hope she replies. This flight crew was very professional, positive and engaging."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Mexico City to Paris,November 2022,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5,yes,8,"  Wonderful flight. Extremely professional crew and delicious food. I didn't love the seat and found it a bit narrow compared to others, but didn't detract from the experience. Would recommend."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Paris CDG,November 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,5,yes,8," A good return trip to PUJ in the Caribbean with AF from CDG. They have a very solid product. Good quality food -two services - and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch. Cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional. Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English, French and Spanish which was a bit much. Also lights a bit bright at other times. Baggage handling and check in fine on both legs. A good solid product from a classic legacy carrier."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Miami to Zanzibar via Paris,August 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,2,"  Air France business class lounge in Zanzibar is non-existent! Air France in Zanzibar does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even if you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure not to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge. When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! That’s called collecting money under false pretences!  I went online to request my gluten-free meal. I called Air France twice to confirm that the meals had been ordered. However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France forgot to provide a gluten free meal. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error. The moral of the story - if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you! That's after you pay the business class fare of $3200!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 190,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Düsseldorf to Paris CDG,October 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,5.0,5,yes,9, Nice short trip on time. We were even served a sandwich and drink on a 45 min flight. Outstanding: due to train delay I arrived at airport just 40 min before flight. Pulled me through first and even baggage arrived.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris Orly to Pointe-à-Pitre,May 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Our flight in June 2022 was already late, and once in the plane and already moving on the ground in order to take-off, the crew detected a fuel leak,o we had to ""pass by technical control"", while remaining in the plane. After having waited 1 hour in the aircraft with an obviously upset crew, they finally told us that this aircraft could not fly and that we have to wait in the airport for another aircraft to continue our journey. After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart ""as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew"". So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : ""We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards"". The flight was in June, nothing has been reimbursed so far, and not even my request has been answered by October. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Mauritius to Paris,October 2022,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2,no,6,"  Air France Business Class Mauritius to Paris Boeing 777. Recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me. Meal selection was limited, forgot to serve me dessert. When asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin. When asking for a napkin, I was given a large table cloth. For breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea. Travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals, you need to feel welcomed and pampered. This was not the case for Air France crew on this flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Dubai,October 2022,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,4.0,5,yes,8,  One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard Wi-Fi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 10/10.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Chicago,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,2,"  I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours. The also didn't have internet on a short leg on our way to Barcelona."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Los Angeles,September 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  We got to CDG airport 3 hours before departure, and we had to run to catch the flight. Long lines, some counters were closed while the ground staff was chatting, no sense of urgency from anyone. The supervisor was less helpful than the others. When we landed at LAX, we didn't find our luggage, and AF personnel had no idea of where it was. It was left in front of the house door the following day without even ringing the bell. We found the bag broken and unrepairable and AF only reimbursed us for 15% of the value for a new bag, with no explanation. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Bucharest to Paris,October 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They have cancelled the flight 15 minutes before departure. They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at >than 48 h after the original one. After spending a lot of time listening to their music while waiting for someone to pick up the phone in Customer Care, they hung up the phone in the middle of my question without providing useful information. They seemed very bothered by the fact that I could have used some help."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Hamburg via Paris,July 2022,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We (a family of 4) made a trip to Hamburg in early July and had a stop in Paris. Our first flight had a 2 1/2 hour delay so we couldn’t catch our connection flight. In Paris we spend over 2 hours to find someone feeling responsible for getting us on a new flight. On one of the biggest International Airports in Europe! After a delay of 6 hours we finally arrived in Hamburg, where we recognized that all our 5 Baggage pieces went missing. We immediately made an AHL Report and headed to our Vacation home without any clothes. We made necessity purchases over the 17 day vacation because our baggage still was nowhere to be found. I made a Claim on the Air France Website for those necessity purchases on day 14 of the vacation. After 21 days I made a claim for lost baggage because the baggage still hasn’t arrived. After 28 days 3 of 5 baggages arrived at our home. The remaining 2 haven’t arrived now for over 3 months. The customer Support took forever to just answer and asking simple questions about data that already has been send over and hasn’t paid any compensation yet. They write mails in which they said you have been on a totally wrong flight on a wrong date. For example they wrote we have been on a flight from Paris to Havana on October 11. Somehow they even closed the claim for the missing baggage although 2 pieces are still missing and on the date of the claim 3 pieces have been already missing for over 21 days. Their Website states that after 21 days you’re baggage is supposed to be lost and you are qualified for a compensation.  Never again Air France, worst experience ever."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Business,Premium Economy,Bogota to Helsinki via Paris,October 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  I had tried to upgrade from economy to premium economy online, but there was no availability. When I was already seating while the plane was about to leave, the flight attendant came to ask if I still wanted to move to premium economy and pay with my miles. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the extra space on this long night flight. The premium economy seat was comfortable and the service friendly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Montpellier,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,2," An unreliable company, with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements, culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm (see picture)! We finally left with 2h delay (for a 1h flight). No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. In-flight ""business"" meal consisted of nuts, one cookie, and a drink. I don't see the difference with ""economy"". Finally arrived starved, late, having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class, all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Vancouver,September 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France, first Toronto to Paris, after being bumped by WestJet, and taking a flight a few hours later, which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver, with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary, no request was too much, and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I don’t write a lot of reviews, and I usually travel Star Alliance, but for Air France, I’ll gladly make exceptions going forward! I will see Air France in business again in April, to Paris and Lisbon, I cant wait! "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New U=York to Paris,October 2022,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,5,yes,9,"  Very Smooth flight. Seat space is very comfortable for economy, 81 cm much more than others offer. Good entertaining and nice crew. Free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack. Only the snack was bad and only dry bread. Delay one hour but arrived on time. Would fly Air France again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Stuttgart via Paris,October 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,2," New York to Stuttgart via Paris. I had a bad experience, on my flight from New York to Paris. Firstly everything was so uncoordinated, the flight got delayed, even the staff from the plane wasn’t in yet even though the boarding would be in 5 minutes. While we was flying there were many inconveniences. First the AC was so cold that I froze the whole time, secondly we flew at night (0:30) and people wanted to sleep but the lights from the airplane were fully on. It was a longer flight but we didn’t receive much to eat and when they came by with water, tea, coffee they didn’t asked me, just a few passengers."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Seattle,September 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,yes,9," We had the best flight attendants. They were lovely. Very attentive to the passengers, very friendly. We were on flight 338 on September 29 leaving Paris to Seattle at 14:15."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Dubai via Paris,September 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hamburg to Punta Cana via Paris CDG,July 2022,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Flights cancelled at short notice, no rebooking options, no compensation. I had to buy a new ticket and it took them over 2 months to refund the previous one. Aircrafts were fine, service was standard for long haul. 3 pieces of luggage delayed for 75 days, no information from their customer service, hard to reach and rude. Worst experience with an airline, they'll never see me again."
Not Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Air France has been improving recently even if I already enjoyed flying this Airline,. CDG could be a small downside for a few people but I've always loved it, even though everything might take a few more minutes, I have always like it because it's beautiful!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Paris via Budapest,April 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The airline sold me a ticket, changing in Paris, but left nowhere near enough time to get through security and run across the airport. It was pretty humiliating, and the staff were incredibly rude. When I complained about it, the customer service lady threatened to cancel my return ticket and actually dismissed me with a 'dusting off her hands' motion. They have completely ignored my request for a refund (it left me £233 out of pocket and with a ruined trip. It took all day just to get home)."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to New York via Paris CDG,January 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My original flight had mechanical problems while in flight, so we diverted to Milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of New York-JFK. It was an awful ordeal. I submitted a delay compensation request back in January, and they finally approved it in September (more than 8 months to process!), but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation. I supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers. They have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point, and now after eight months of waiting, they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount. All I'm asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the European Union. Nothing more, nothing less. "
Not Verified ,A350/E190,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Nuremberg via Paris,September 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Overall, a pleasant flight. The mini croissant served on the E190 was tasty. As for the food on the A350, it was satisfying enough but was not up to my expectations. Flight attendants were smiling."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Paris via Bangaluru,September 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,7," Excellent service at Bengaluru. Due to the short time in b/w transfers one bag did not arrive. However Air France had already sent a list of missing baggage and they informed us whilst we were at the luggage carousel, this saving us time. They tracked where our baggage was and sent it on the next flight. It arrived safely. Very helpful staff at Bengaluru who helped us when we were tired and stressed. Thank you Air France! Re food though it's a different review as the quality was poor, food passed off as Indian, really wasn't food any Indian would eat!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Conakry to London Heathrow via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,2," Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa. Terrible airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,First Class,Montréal to Paris,September 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,9," Excellent flight from Paris to Montréal, I wouldn't have recommended Air France 6 or 7 years ago, but this airline is really improving. The cabin crew was pleasing and careful, the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class. The only negative point is that Paris CDG is really disorganized, it is probably one of the worst airports I've had experienced with Amsterdam AMS in Europe. I really hope that it will improve within the next years."
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Zurich,August 2022,2.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight from Zurich to Paris was an hour late.  My return flight experience was worse: I paid for a Siège Plus (11D) with extra legroom. However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag. Between AF and the useless local transporter, I have wasted two days. Is this how AF treats its passengers? Is a Flying Blue Gold member impressed by this experience? I am very frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism from start to finish. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bangalore via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day. You saved us and we are truly grateful. We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Trondheim to London via Amsterdam,April 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Punta Cana via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to say that the airline and cabin crew were absolutely brilliant. They were very attentive and in hand if we needed them. The inflight food was delicious and tasty, not bland like other airlines. We pre-paid for our seats and we’re very pleased with the extra leg room outbound and the Solo seats coming home. I would like to thank all the staff from check in until when we landed. So professional and quick so the queues were small and manageable. Air France made our holiday more amazing by delivering such a wonderful experience. Thank You."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,Bucharest to New York via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Outstanding service. I have travelled from OTP to JFK via CDG and return in business class. A great experience from the lounge, food, beverages to the comfort of the seat. On the return segment JFK -CDG I was upgraded in La Premiere due to my Platinum Ultimate status. The onboard service was state of the art. The champagne the best I have ever tasted. The FAs and the pursers attitude and service flow less. Looking forward to my next trip with AF."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Prague,August 2022,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage. They weigh both bags and if both bags are even 1KG over their 12 KG weight limit they make you walk back to the Air France check-in area to spend 110 euros and 25 minutes to check one bag (not both bags even though they were both weighed together). This would make sense if the luggage was oversized and didn’t fit in the overhead bins but our small luggage was overweight was because we travel with large books. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Beirut via Manchester / Paris,July 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight for an Air France / Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to Beirut. Once I landed in Beirut airport I notice I'm missing one checked bag so I reached out to the missing luggage office and file claim. 2 days later I got update by email that my bag was found, and it will be forwarded to Beirut. I contacted airport for my bag, and they said my bag did not arrive. 2 days later suddenly the claim I filed in the airport was closed and when I contacted customer service, they didn't know how the claim was closed or who closed it. I filed online claim again, since then I have been calling customer service every day about my luggage with no updates. Nobody could explain how my first claim was closed and keep saying no update on my luggage. I filed claim for necessary purchase but I didn't get any reimbursement, then after 21 days filed claim for lost luggage. I started calling air France every day, I got to speak with supervisor who made clear your bag was lost and there is no way for passenger to talk to claim department unless they call you. I asked how long it takes to get my reimbursement, he said, we have long queue and this might take several months. So they lost my bag with promise they will reimburse me when they decide to do with no timeframe. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris CDG,July 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,4,yes,6,"  We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change. Still, I live in hope that Air France ups its game on the service front."

I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner. Shame on Air France. I've never encountered such incompetence."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,August 2022,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We just had a return flight scheduled via Air France on August 1st. We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags. We are told to return in the morning to pick up our other 2 large checked bags that had been pulled from the plane. We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address. Unbelievable service from Air France. No apologies from anyone or care for the extraordinary mess of lines! One bag has been found but the other is untraceable."

Lounge welcome none, food not eatable, Champagne from a cheap brand. These are the only bad news from 2 flights that went smoothly, with excellent on-board service. 16 years old 777, retrofitted, but showing signals of usage. Small (14 seats) business class cabin, therefore very quiet. Connecting in CDG was made easy, with separate immigration for connecting passengers. Lounge in CDG was packed at 6:00 AM ! As usual MRS baggage delivery at MRS is a shame, with no respect for priority bags. Not AF fault; just bad service form third party services."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Paris ,August 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1," Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir. Avoid Air France's archaic customer service system at all costs."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Paris to Düsseldorf,June 2022,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached. All in all very disappointing."

It was supposed to depart at 11:55 pm and 30 minutes Before we were supposed to take off they canceled it and told us they are going to give us a hotel to stay in until they get us a new flight, but 4 hours waiting in the airport until they got us a hotel in Manhattan witch is an hour away from the airport. After that they told us to pay for everything we need and save a copy of the receipt and send it to the airline for a refund.

This trips' flights with Air France were clearly the worst. We were only on this AF flight with our Delta reservations because of code sharing. Not only were the flight attendants condescending, food inedible and the ground service bizarre,  to add insult to injury, they lost our luggage and cannot locate it. AF's service desk is impossible to get on the phone. I have been trying for a day and a half since we returned to ask about the status of my missing luggage. We called Delta and after a wait of over an hour were told we should have called AF. Finally after a wait of over 2 hours we got a person to speak at AF -- the person manning the phones said they live in a status of perpetual wonderment as to where the luggage was and had certainly no idea where mine was. Frustration, upset, anger, disappointment. I will never fly Air France again. If you have an option, take another airline unless you can pack all your clothes in a carry on. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington, DC to Athens via Paris",June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1," We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you. We were not the only people who spent the night at the airport, there were many families with kids who slept on the floor. Absolutely horrible the way they speak to you and also condescending."

However boarding at Marseille was one of the most messy I have ever seen, due to the lack of instructions of staff. Direct channel from Terminal 2F to Terminal 2E (K), with dedicated immigration and no security check was of great relief. Splendid. Catering at lounge was excellent. Boarding of flight to YUL was also a torture, as we had to wait under the sun (during the heat wave) on a ramp during more than 20 minutes. On the other hand service, food and comfort on AF A350 Business class were exceptional, showing a brutal improvement. Air France could have deserved a 10, if they had learned to board with SQ staff."

A gate between the queue to enter the departure lounge and the lounge itself was left open and one passenger managed to wander through, by-passing the gate agent. Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks). Probably because of the slow boarding process at Heathrow our first leg to CDG operated 25 minutes late, resulting in us having to sprint up and down staircases at CDG to catch our onward flight to Lisbon. Our baggage made it too -- phew! All in all this was a pleasant experience, especially onboard."

I've called the help line over 12 times and have been on hold for upwards of 45 minutes before the line hanging up on me. None of the support options seem to work and I've done my best to be patient, but I would really like an update. On the flight, we were given our meals and for an hour and a half, they let our trays sit there. They didn't pick up the trays for so long that people were helping each other out by holding their trash so they could move about the cabin. The flight attendants were nice, even if not very prompt. They seemed as upset about the situation as we were. I'm still on hold (day 2 trying to speak to someone) as I write this review. "

Air France staff was courteous, attentive and polite. The food was better than I could have imagined, we were served both dinner and breakfast. We flew on the Boeing 777-300ER first row in business class (First Class for this particular plane), the plane was a newer version, has ample leg room with an angled flat bed for comfortable seating. The aircraft was clean and everything in my seating area was in working order. My next trip back to Senegal will be with Air France!"

We were scheduled to leave Italy at 6.10 am on July 12, to catch a connecting flight in Paris to JFK. The night before they changed our flight to 7.45 am so we would miss our connecting flight. Instead of scheduling the next available flight from Paris to JFK, they changed our connecting flight multiple times and in the end, we had a 14 hour delay in the airport. No one communicated the reason for this long delay, we can only assume that they gave our seats away to the passengers that had already been stuck in the airport for 24-48 hours for a plane to JFK. The only compensation Air France offered us was a $31 food voucher for five passengers to hold us over for a fourteen hour delay. It is apparent that this airline is not at all prepared to accommodate the influx of passengers flying their airline and definitely does not respect their passengers time. We will never fly this airline again!"

We were originally going from Lyon to Venice. The new route costed us a delay of more than 2 hours. Each flight we boarded, or checked-in for, we were told they did not have a seat for us until everyone else had boarded. It felt like we had bought last-minute budget tickets and treated less than everybody else. Yet we had spent a large amount to travel to Venice. The entire journey we were still grateful we could fly and hopeful we could get to our destination. It was stressful to say the least. This has been a bad experience and I don't recommend Air France."

Last Saturday, I received a message saying the luggage was found. But I have not received the luggage yet.

This flight was 1.5 hours late, which seems normal for that flight.  AF had tried to throw me off my connecting flight and put me on one for the next day but the check-in girl at BKK managed to reverse it and I made the flight. I asked on exit how far away my next gate was but they didn’t have a clue. A 2-3-2 business class is decades out of date and the cabin crew were men who did their job in a minimalist manner but there was no friendliness or engagement with the passengers, downright miserable. The food felt very overly reheated. There looks like a lot of pages of movies but a lot of it was many copies of the same film, no idea what that was about as you choose your language when you click on play. They get round their terrible performance by using that awful and insulting catch-all phrase, “For operational reasons”. When we landed at CDG there was another plane still at our gate."

The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing. So basically if you take Air France and the baggage is lost during the flight, you will not be able to do anything and no one from Air France can help you."

I knew there were cases of large queues for luggage check-ins and anticipating this, I left for the airport 4 hrs earlier and arrived 3.5hrs earlier than my flight time. And as expected, the line was huge. Despite the fact that they had automatic machines where you could check in your luggage, those machines opened late and 3-5 members of Air France were operating those counters. When the machines started running, people did not know how to use them. For example, if your bag were overweight by a certain threshold, the machine would get stuck. Thus, requiring human interference (or maybe people just didn’t know) to make it start working again. Secondly, the machine did not mention that you need to check in your hand luggage also. So, people had to come back from security. There was also a long line of people printing luggage tags after getting in line. Thus coming back and forth into the queues and stalling the people behind them. There were people just getting in line without waiting for their turn.  Some of the cabin crew were gloomy."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Firenze to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Thank you Air France for providing exceptional customer service. I read these reviews and they mostly appear to be only a bad experience. But my experience had the potential to be bad, but you handled it exceedingly well. My flight from Firenze to CDG was going to arrive late and I would miss my connection. In flight, the attendant told me I was going to miss the connection, my new flight was already booked for the next day, and that I would be provided a hotel and meals. When I arrived every word of this was true. I stayed in a very nice airport hotel (Golden Lotus) that provided exceptional buffet style food, I used the hotel shuttle, and you also gave me a meal voucher as well for the airport. I was concerned leaving my luggage overnight in the airport, but it arrived safely in LAX the following day. You could not have made this any easier, and I was really only delayed about 12 hours in total. I've flown with you 3 times now to Italy and you will always be my first choice. Yes, occasionally I may experience an inconvenience, but I will always remember how you handled this perfectly. My only suggestion for the foreign traveler would be maybe to have a printed map (handed to them by the flight attendant) with the details where the Air France Customer Service kiosk is located, and also where the hotel shuttles are located. It's such a huge airport and this took me a little time to navigate."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Paris via Tunis,June 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3," I take a yearly trip to Tunisia, and I've flown with a lot of airlines over the years. I have encountered delays and issues with flight logistics but it was always handled smoothly and professionally by the airline. This time I tried Air France because they offered a trip without much waiting time before the corresponding flight, and what a huge mistake I made. First trip from Montreal to Paris was cancelled out of nowhere. No explanation was given and the only heads up I got was an email that was filtered as a spam since they sent it through a shady email. They rescheduled that flight for another one that got delayed for 2 hours. No heads up this time and of course no explanation. The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter). Needless to say that this is my first and last trip with AF. I really recommend anybody flying long distance to avoid AF at all costs, they do not seem to be able to handle the logistics of a corresponding trip."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Nice,June 2022,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety. "

Of course the airline lost the luggage and now in Bordeaux they sent an email that one cannot respond to for sending the luggage to our hotel but they gave the wrong number to call back and cannot get in touch to coordinate the lost bag reaching our hotel. 2 days after landing in Bordeaux still no bag. Stay away from this airline, I will never book with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Mumbai to Los Angeles via Paris,June 2022,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3,no,5,"  I was dissatisfied with the business class flight from Paris to Mumbai round trip. The flat bed was more like a recliner seat and my food was not up to the quality. Flight back from Paris to LAX took off late and I was very hungry. Flight attendant gave me menu, I chose salmon, she mentioned that is not available since it has been taken. No issues but when I paid a premium to travel business, should not I expect better. Given vegetarian which was very salty."

The wonderful ladies at the Air France counter at the airport were, through determined shuffling, able to accommodate all of us on the next flight to Vancouver. There was otherwise a real possibility that some of would have had to stay overnight. Kudos to the attentiveness of the Air France agents!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Rome via Paris,May 2022,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Osaka to Rome via Paris. I chose to travel with Air France  because it was the ""cheapest"" and the ""shortest"" route. I would recommend flying with them as the trip was ok, but there are things to improve! Duration of the first flight is 15 hours. Although I was worried for this very long trip, time passed quickly aboard. I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !! A particular appreciation for a female flight attendant on the flight from Osaka, and a male flight attendant on the flight to Rome. Both very kind and helpful."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Montreal,June 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4,yes,10,  Just flew from Copenhagen to Paris to Montreal on June 17th. We were behind schedule when we landed at CDG with only a small chance of making our connecting flight that day. My wife made it to the correct gate and was able to board while I ended up at the wrong gate. I would like to offer a huge thank you to Captain Emmanuel Rollier who insisted the plane would not leave until I arrived at the plane. The rest of the crew were equally supportive and helped create a positive ending to what had been a very stressful day. Thanks again to Captain and crew. 
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Vancouver,June 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1,no,1,  Horrible service and food. Very dirty bathrooms. The cushions or pillows had stains all over. Old airplane. They asked if I wanted chicken or pasta. I said pasta. They said we don’t have it and left. It’s a disgusting airline.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to mention the name of Mr Sunil Lohat who did a great job by helping us and making our journey very comfortable. I think without the help of this gentleman, it wouldn't have been possible for us to board the flight. Mr Sunil helped us till the last moment and ensured that we board the flight. He did everything which a customer needs during any technical hitches which is not known to the passenger. Hats off to such a committed and helping person.  He really made our day in the time of crisis and now I have landed Toronto without any hassles. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A220-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris CDG to Berlin,April 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,9," One way flight from Paris CDG to Berlin BER in April. A smooth and hassle-free flight on a brand new plane. The Airbus A220 is comfortable and offers free WIFI for Whatsapp and other messengers. Air France gives you a free small sandwich and a drink of your choice, alcoholic beverages included. Airport services were also fine. Check-in and security check in CDG took only a few minutes and in Berlin I got my luggage within 5 minutes. I think currently AF is the best airline in Europe."
Not Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Sint Maarten,June 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Was pleasantly surprised with Air France as I was expecting the worst experience. The aircraft felt up to date, entertainment system worked fine and had plenty of choices. Crew were very friendly and personally greeted us and asked if we needed anything. The meal services were great, the main meal was the best one I had in economy for quite sometime as mostly they are inedible but this was good, chicken with mushrooms and polenta, a small salad with Camargue rice and a delicious small pastry for dessert, coffee and wine. The meal service before landing was presented in a small gift bag and contents were tasty, a nice touch I thought."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington  to Florence via Paris CDG,June 2022,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,2,"  Delayed on initial flight for both our departure and return trips. This caused us to miss our connection. Each time Air France made it incredibly difficult to rebook. We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent. I will never take any airline that connects in CDG and will absolutely avoid Air France at all costs. The flight attendants were great and the only positive interactions we had were with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Paris via Heathrow,June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  I flew Air France return for my trip to the UK. Seats were small, service apathetic, CDG was a huge disappointment. On the way back they lost my suitcase, still MIA and no feedback from the airline. You have to hold on the phone for ages, get a surly customer service person or your call dropped."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Seoul via Amsterdam,April 2022,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,,2.0,2,no,1,"  Air France / KLM lure you with the free change ticket. Unluckily, it's an hoax. To begin with, no matter what's the actual price difference, I was asked to pay an amount of money that equal/ed the price of the full ticket at minimum. Eventually, I decided to accept it and was going to pay to change the ticket for my return flight. while I was shown several options, only a tiny percentage were available to book, maybe 30%. All the rest gave a system error and a message to call their hotline, which cost me a lot of wasted time. When I called the hotline, they told the flight was available, but cost more than the full price of a one way ticket. The actual flight was OK, but this rebooking experience was so disappointing and time consuming that I cannot help but to give KLM a 0."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London Heathrow via Paris,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Awful customer service, who are clearly trained to keep you in a loop of confusion, in hope that you give up on whatever it is you need help with. Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong. It amazes me that big companies like Air France can get away with having no customer service whatsoever."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Toronto,June 2022,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,3,no,1," Paris to Toronto. I spent the last 3 weeks travelling to different parts of Europe. I have taken 5 flights total, including my flight home with Air France. I am extremely disappointed with the airport and baggage situation. I arrived at the airport and had my luggage that was not overweight and my carry on luggage that was 12kg as required and purse. I checked my luggage in and proceeded to the security. When arriving at security they weighed my carry on and indicated I had to add my purse on top. Due to my purse and carry on luggage being 14kg together. They stated my carry on or purse needed to be paid for and put through baggage or I needed to remove items and throw them out. I had to go all the way back and pay for my carry on luggage that did not have a lock and had valuable items in it to be put through with baggage. I spent 85 euros that I had no intention in spending as I ensured to make my luggage and carry on for the weight requirements. I’m extremely disappointed that this occurred and felt it was very uncalled for as this has been the only airline who requires a shoulder purse to be weighted."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Geneva to Buenos Aires via Paris ,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  First leg GVA-CDG was delayed due to circumstances outside of AF's control, I completely understand. But I still managed to get to the gate to my CDG-EZE flight with just 5-10 minutes delay. we arrived to find the plane still at the gate but boarding closed. So AF's team had to deny boarding to the 20+ passengers that arrived just a few minutes late. We were then sent to the AF counter AND were assigned a hotel some 40 minutes drive from the airport (this was almost midnight by then). We were told a shuttle would take us to the hotel. We come out to an empty parking lot, no shuttle in sight. In the end we had to google the hotel's name and pay for a uber to take us there. We arrive to the hotel (which was partially under construction) at around 1AM, and the hotel manager has no idea if and when AF will send a shuttle to bring me back to the airport. AF set me in an Iberia flight via Madrid, so I had to be back at the airport at 5.30AM.  I make it back to the airport, to find out my luggage was not transferred by AF to Iberia, so I would have to leave without it. I spent the next week in Argentina without my luggage, unsuccessfully trying to get information from AF and/or Iberia."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Business Class,San Francisco to Paris,May 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,3.0,5,yes,8,"  Business class cabin is not the newest one in airline industry but still very good. The window seat is spacious with very much room for ones feet (perfect in flat bed mode) and very comfy. I slept very well. Privacy could be a little bit better but will be improved with the new suite type of seats for B777. IFE: Screen size and selection are good, picture quality is not on par with modern systems - but of course you can not expect this. The crew has been very friendly and helpful, food was plenty and delicious with a great starter (picture) and one of the best steaks I ever had on board (sorry, forgot to take a picture). Check in in SFO was very slow (almost 40 minutes for 12 people) but otherwise no complaints. Lounge was small and crowded, but food, beverages and WIFI were very good. I really liked the whole experience and appreciated the attentive and cordial service on board. Well done, Air France. I am looking forward to fly with you again long haul."

Shameful and inexcusable on the part of Air France."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris,May 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,1," Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris. Very disrespectful to their customers. Initially, the return flight was booked for a Saturday evening. But 2 months in advance Air France cancelled the flight. Since there was only one flight a day, we had to reschedule for the Sunday flight. Air France did not want to book a hotel or pay (part of the extra hotel costs). On check-in at Abuja, check-in was denied, because the flight was scheduled for the day before (Saturday), doh. Even though I was carrying the ticket with the new date, the booking confirmation and the e-mail about the cancellation, they refused boarding. At long last, the ticket office printed a new ticket for Sunday, and informed us, that they would not charge us at this time. On arrival in Paris, there was a technical problem with the bridge, which delayed the flight by half an hour. Air France staff refused to assist to help us catch the connecting flight. As a result, we missed the flight. At the transfer counter, the helpful staff informed us of this fact, as if we were to blame for it. On arrival in Amsterdam, of course, our bags were missing. We claimed the missing bags immediately. It took Air France a full week, to deliver the bags (from Paris to Amsterdam). When they eventually delivered the bags, one was damaged (broken handle). We also claimed the damage on the handle immediately. So far it has been 3 weeks, and Air France is not responding to any requests, nor handling our damage claim. I would row a boat to Nigeria than fly with an airline that is so disinterested in their customers. Never again."

They provided one meal ~1.5 hours after the take off and then we were starving as the last one was ~1.5 before landing. Both were unsatisfactory for such a long flight, equal to those offered in 3 hour flights of other airlines such Aegean. Also one of the flight attendants woke us up (4 people) at 4.30am while everyone was sleeping because she wanted to find her bag. She first opened the cases above our seats and after she realized that her bag was not there she poked the person sitting on the outermost seat to ask where is the bag and “why” it’s not there, loudly and visibly annoyed. So rude. For the record, the bag was in the next (front) case but I guess it’s easier to ask someone instead of looking a little further."

Having waited for a while in Mumbai for my suitcase, I finally made it to the counter to file a claim.  It took me 4 hours to get out of the airport trying to file a claim for the missing baggage. The Air France representative  Mr. Akash was nothing but polite, courteous, and a star that worked under pressure. Whilst the process was disorganized and lacked manpower, he was single-handedly managing AF travelers.  I hope they track and manage to deliver my luggage on time. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Palma de Mallorca via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,,3.0,3,no,3,"  I arrived to Palma de Mallorca, Spain from San Francisco, California on September 23rd, 2022. I filed my missing baggage claim on the 30th of September, 2022 and presented receipts for some of the articles I had replaced within that time frame between my arrival and my request for compensation. I was awarded the money compensation I applied for and the Air France Customer Care Assistance said they would have the money wired to my bank account over the next several weeks. I haven't seen a penny of the compensation. I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information. Instead of further investigation or engagement with me, I received and email stating that the claim was handled ""correctly"" and that no further correspondence with me would be continued based on this topic. So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation. Be careful with your items with Air France and I recommend keeping more of your valuables and preferred clothing in your carry on bag. I lost a lot more than I can afford to replace on my Spanish income. I would share screenshots of the email in question but it is forbidden. "

The main meal was decent but the second meal was a small snack delivered in a small bag. The staff in the plane from Chicago to Paris was not very friendly. The staff in the way back from Paris to Chicago was very kind and helpful. Big difference. Lastly, my checked bag didn't make it to Chicago. The staff at Chicago didn't really want to help me. One spent a few moments trying to register a claim, gave up, handed me a card with instructions and walked away. I tried someone else about 15 minutes later, while she was not happy to help, she did complete the claim for me which I appreciated. The bag was delivered to my door, 200 miles from the airport, the next day was was great. I would fly Air France again."

However the Paris to Bangkok segment was excellent on all counts. The service provided by Aurelie Luche was outstanding, professional and ever so efficient and friendly. The food for the 11hour and twenty minute flight was plentiful and tasty. The overall comfort of the seat was not that outstanding but I have to say that what was my first flight with Air France it certainly won't be my last. Well done to the crew, especially to Aurelie."

Just after take off, one of my ear buds became dislodged and fell to floor. I was not able to find it for duration of flight. After everyone else deplaned, I searched to no avail, and was about to quit the search. 3 flight attendants joined the search, and one of them found missing ear bud 4 rows behind my row.

They have a very solid product. Good quality food -two services - and even champagne in economy which is a great classy touch. Cabin crew were immaculately presented on both legs and friendly and highly professional. Additional drinks on demand. IFE is not to my taste but I am not a big user of IFE. If there was any fault it would be the numerous announcements in English, French and Spanish which was a bit much. Also lights a bit bright at other times. Baggage handling and check in fine on both legs. A good solid product from a classic legacy carrier."

Air France in Zanzibar does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even if you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure not to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge. When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! That’s called collecting money under false pretences!  I went online to request my gluten-free meal. I called Air France twice to confirm that the meals had been ordered. However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France forgot to provide a gluten free meal. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error. The moral of the story - if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you! That's after you pay the business class fare of $3200!"

After waiting 2 hours in a very limited area, Air France announces that we can eventually not depart ""as we will land in Pointe-à-Pitre too late because there is a curfew"". So we have to move in the main lobby to pre-check-in for the next day, but we have to wait again as they don't know from which airport in Paris we have to leave the following day. So the desk remains closed. It's already been 5 hours since the trouble started, and at last they provide us with a bottle of water. Nothing before. Everyone is getting very upset with the situation and waiting for Air France to organize our unexpected night in Paris, to finally hear : ""We will not take care of your accomodation and transportation, please make your own plans, we will reimburse you afterwards"". The flight was in June, nothing has been reimbursed so far, and not even my request has been answered by October. "

Recent seats and good food but got the impression that the cabin crew forgot me. Meal selection was limited, forgot to serve me dessert. When asked it was served on the table without table cloth without any napkin. When asking for a napkin, I was given a large table cloth. For breakfast had to use the call button a few times to get an orange juice and another tea. Travelling is not only about cabin product seats and meals, you need to feel welcomed and pampered. This was not the case for Air France crew on this flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Dubai,October 2022,5.0,5.0,1.0,,5.0,4.0,5,yes,8,  One of the most comfortable Premium Economy seats. Brand new aircraft. Flights on time both outbound and inbound. Onboard staff very courteous and professional. Onboard Wi-Fi probably the best connection I have experienced in the air. The only downsize is the food. So far the worse even compared to an average economy class. Food was disappointing. If not for the food I would have voted 10/10.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Chicago,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,2,"  I will never fly Air France again and urge you not to if you have a choice. For reference, I previously worked for an airline, so I am very familiar with flying. First, for our first short flight our Viking Cruise got us to the airport 4 hours early (this was not Air France's fault), but Air France didn't open their ticket counter for another two plus hours, so we couldn't check in and had to sit with our bags in ticketing for a long time. On the long leg of our trip, the 8.5 hour flight, we didn't leave until about 30 minutes late (we were sitting on the plane) and then they didn't tell us until we'd already taken off that we wouldn't have internet for the flight. I did not pay 5k for my seat to not be able to contact my pet sitter or download a book for 9 hours. The also didn't have internet on a short leg on our way to Barcelona."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Los Angeles,September 2022,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,2,no,1,"  We got to CDG airport 3 hours before departure, and we had to run to catch the flight. Long lines, some counters were closed while the ground staff was chatting, no sense of urgency from anyone. The supervisor was less helpful than the others. When we landed at LAX, we didn't find our luggage, and AF personnel had no idea of where it was. It was left in front of the house door the following day without even ringing the bell. We found the bag broken and unrepairable and AF only reimbursed us for 15% of the value for a new bag, with no explanation. "

They have booked me another flight without asking about my preferences at >than 48 h after the original one. After spending a lot of time listening to their music while waiting for someone to pick up the phone in Customer Care, they hung up the phone in the middle of my question without providing useful information. They seemed very bothered by the fact that I could have used some help."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Hamburg via Paris,July 2022,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We (a family of 4) made a trip to Hamburg in early July and had a stop in Paris. Our first flight had a 2 1/2 hour delay so we couldn’t catch our connection flight. In Paris we spend over 2 hours to find someone feeling responsible for getting us on a new flight. On one of the biggest International Airports in Europe! After a delay of 6 hours we finally arrived in Hamburg, where we recognized that all our 5 Baggage pieces went missing. We immediately made an AHL Report and headed to our Vacation home without any clothes. We made necessity purchases over the 17 day vacation because our baggage still was nowhere to be found. I made a Claim on the Air France Website for those necessity purchases on day 14 of the vacation. After 21 days I made a claim for lost baggage because the baggage still hasn’t arrived. After 28 days 3 of 5 baggages arrived at our home. The remaining 2 haven’t arrived now for over 3 months. The customer Support took forever to just answer and asking simple questions about data that already has been send over and hasn’t paid any compensation yet. They write mails in which they said you have been on a totally wrong flight on a wrong date. For example they wrote we have been on a flight from Paris to Havana on October 11. Somehow they even closed the claim for the missing baggage although 2 pieces are still missing and on the date of the claim 3 pieces have been already missing for over 21 days. Their Website states that after 21 days you’re baggage is supposed to be lost and you are qualified for a compensation.  Never again Air France, worst experience ever."

When I was already seating while the plane was about to leave, the flight attendant came to ask if I still wanted to move to premium economy and pay with my miles. This was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the extra space on this long night flight. The premium economy seat was comfortable and the service friendly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Montpellier,October 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1,no,2," An unreliable company, with careless customer service. My flight was permanently further delayed with nonsense announcements, culminating when Air France App claimed at 6h07 pm the flight was scheduled to leave at 5h15pm (see picture)! We finally left with 2h delay (for a 1h flight). No WiFi on board contrary to what was advertised before the flight and even on board. The cabin crew was unapologetic. No way to work or inform business partners at MPL of my scheduled arrival time. In-flight ""business"" meal consisted of nuts, one cookie, and a drink. I don't see the difference with ""economy"". Finally arrived starved, late, having lost my business day. Despite Platinum loyalty status and flying business class, all this was considered not worth any compensation by AF customer service. I regret not having traveled by train."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Vancouver,September 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I was very fortunate to fly business with Air France, first Toronto to Paris, after being bumped by WestJet, and taking a flight a few hours later, which was excellent. Then even better was my flight Paris to Vancouver, with the lovely and very efficient flight attendant. I felt her performance alone deserved attention for how special it was. The food and wine was extraordinary, no request was too much, and I enjoyed getting to try to converse in French. I don’t write a lot of reviews, and I usually travel Star Alliance, but for Air France, I’ll gladly make exceptions going forward! I will see Air France in business again in April, to Paris and Lisbon, I cant wait! "

Seat space is very comfortable for economy, 81 cm much more than others offer. Good entertaining and nice crew. Free champagne and a nice dinner with several courses free wines and a pre landing snack. Only the snack was bad and only dry bread. Delay one hour but arrived on time. Would fly Air France again."

I had a bad experience, on my flight from New York to Paris. Firstly everything was so uncoordinated, the flight got delayed, even the staff from the plane wasn’t in yet even though the boarding would be in 5 minutes. While we was flying there were many inconveniences. First the AC was so cold that I froze the whole time, secondly we flew at night (0:30) and people wanted to sleep but the lights from the airplane were fully on. It was a longer flight but we didn’t receive much to eat and when they came by with water, tea, coffee they didn’t asked me, just a few passengers."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Dubai via Paris,September 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," London to Dubai via Paris. After being unable to make my journey and trying to rebook my ticket the customer service has been utterly terrible. They wouldn't offer a refund, instead offered to rebook and call back once the fees were calculated within 48hrs. This never happened, and when trying to check my flight details on the app and found there was nothing there - I called them back and was told my £825 ticket was cancelled. I have spent many days talking to various people over the phone having no clue, but at the same time scared to summon one of their supervisors who are always 'in a meeting' - it's been a month now. They now refuse to do anything about my tickets, constantly hanging up without offering any resolve, the outsourced call centre obviously doesn't care for the reputation of the Airline. I have never had this bad customer service with any airline regarding cancellations and rebooking/changing of a flight and I've been travelling to medical conferences and meetings for 50+ years. Unless you really have to, I would avoid this airline like the plague (I only took this airline based on my daughter's word and recent travel), they do not care for your custom, they don't even have any Air-France staff at the check-in desks in Heathrow."

I had to buy a new ticket and it took them over 2 months to refund the previous one. Aircrafts were fine, service was standard for long haul. 3 pieces of luggage delayed for 75 days, no information from their customer service, hard to reach and rude. Worst experience with an airline, they'll never see me again."

CDG could be a small downside for a few people but I've always loved it, even though everything might take a few more minutes, I have always like it because it's beautiful!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Paris via Budapest,April 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The airline sold me a ticket, changing in Paris, but left nowhere near enough time to get through security and run across the airport. It was pretty humiliating, and the staff were incredibly rude. When I complained about it, the customer service lady threatened to cancel my return ticket and actually dismissed me with a 'dusting off her hands' motion. They have completely ignored my request for a refund (it left me £233 out of pocket and with a ruined trip. It took all day just to get home)."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to New York via Paris CDG,January 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  My original flight had mechanical problems while in flight, so we diverted to Milan and endured hours of delay in getting to our final destination of New York-JFK. It was an awful ordeal. I submitted a delay compensation request back in January, and they finally approved it in September (more than 8 months to process!), but only for one of the two passengers in the reservation. I supplied them with all of the documentation they requested for both passengers. They have been unfriendly and unhelpful in getting to this point, and now after eight months of waiting, they are making me still fight them for the proper compensation amount. All I'm asking is that they follow the standard regulations set forth by the European Union. Nothing more, nothing less. "

The mini croissant served on the E190 was tasty. As for the food on the A350, it was satisfying enough but was not up to my expectations. Flight attendants were smiling."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Paris via Bangaluru,September 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5,yes,7," Excellent service at Bengaluru. Due to the short time in b/w transfers one bag did not arrive. However Air France had already sent a list of missing baggage and they informed us whilst we were at the luggage carousel, this saving us time. They tracked where our baggage was and sent it on the next flight. It arrived safely. Very helpful staff at Bengaluru who helped us when we were tired and stressed. Thank you Air France! Re food though it's a different review as the quality was poor, food passed off as Indian, really wasn't food any Indian would eat!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Conakry to London Heathrow via Paris,September 2022,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,2," Delayed baggage, and even longer delays (3 days!) in shipping it to me. Air France has scheduled far too short a connection time in Paris for its flights from West Africa (Guinea and Central African Republic), and given the change in terminal and slow security at CDG, I always end up having to run in order to make the final call for my London flight - very stressful. Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available! I will instead now vote with my feet, and stop using Air France for my flights to West Africa. Terrible airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Solo Leisure,First Class,Montréal to Paris,September 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4,yes,9," Excellent flight from Paris to Montréal, I wouldn't have recommended Air France 6 or 7 years ago, but this airline is really improving. The cabin crew was pleasing and careful, the flight landed earlier than announced and the food was pretty good for an economy class. The only negative point is that Paris CDG is really disorganized, it is probably one of the worst airports I've had experienced with Amsterdam AMS in Europe. I really hope that it will improve within the next years."
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Zurich,August 2022,2.0,5.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight from Zurich to Paris was an hour late.  My return flight experience was worse: I paid for a Siège Plus (11D) with extra legroom. However, there were no such seats (no emergency exit seats) on the Embraer 170. I now have to spend time filing an online claim for a reimbursement. My baggage was not delivered in Zurich. This is not the first time my bags have been lost by Air France even in a tiny terminal like 2G in Paris.  The bag finally arrived at Zurich airport this morning, one and a half days late. The local transporter never contacted me to schedule delivery. I had to call AF and insist on getting the local transporter's telephone number. I was told the bag was on its way, despite the fact that nobody had called me to check if I was home. I was told it would be with me between 3 and 5 p.m. No bag arrived. I then called the transporter again, who checked and said the driver claimed I was not at home. Hello! I had stayed at home the entire day. I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag. Between AF and the useless local transporter, I have wasted two days. Is this how AF treats its passengers? Is a Flying Blue Gold member impressed by this experience? I am very frustrated by the utter lack of professionalism from start to finish. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bangalore via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,,,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew. I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be. A nightmare! We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible. From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods. The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?"" After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off. It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day. You saved us and we are truly grateful. We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Trondheim to London via Amsterdam,April 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  This was a booking with KLM for two passengers made and paid by myself but one passenger cancelled. I was promised a refund against a fee. The refund was never made. I asked various Air France employees if there was anything I could do to solve the situation.  It seems to me that niceties in the cabin are cheap to get, and anyway, those are paid for. When real issues arise, Air France is incapable of solving them, and, indeed, does not care to do so. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 787,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Punta Cana via Paris,August 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5,yes,10,"  I would like to say that the airline and cabin crew were absolutely brilliant. They were very attentive and in hand if we needed them. The inflight food was delicious and tasty, not bland like other airlines. We pre-paid for our seats and we’re very pleased with the extra leg room outbound and the Solo seats coming home. I would like to thank all the staff from check in until when we landed. So professional and quick so the queues were small and manageable. Air France made our holiday more amazing by delivering such a wonderful experience. Thank You."

I have travelled from OTP to JFK via CDG and return in business class. A great experience from the lounge, food, beverages to the comfort of the seat. On the return segment JFK -CDG I was upgraded in La Premiere due to my Platinum Ultimate status. The onboard service was state of the art. The champagne the best I have ever tasted. The FAs and the pursers attitude and service flow less. Looking forward to my next trip with AF."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Prague,August 2022,3.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  They stop passengers at security to weigh their carry-on luggage. They weigh both bags and if both bags are even 1KG over their 12 KG weight limit they make you walk back to the Air France check-in area to spend 110 euros and 25 minutes to check one bag (not both bags even though they were both weighed together). This would make sense if the luggage was oversized and didn’t fit in the overhead bins but our small luggage was overweight was because we travel with large books. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Beirut via Manchester / Paris,July 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight for an Air France / Virgin Atlantic flight from Orlando to Beirut. Once I landed in Beirut airport I notice I'm missing one checked bag so I reached out to the missing luggage office and file claim. 2 days later I got update by email that my bag was found, and it will be forwarded to Beirut. I contacted airport for my bag, and they said my bag did not arrive. 2 days later suddenly the claim I filed in the airport was closed and when I contacted customer service, they didn't know how the claim was closed or who closed it. I filed online claim again, since then I have been calling customer service every day about my luggage with no updates. Nobody could explain how my first claim was closed and keep saying no update on my luggage. I filed claim for necessary purchase but I didn't get any reimbursement, then after 21 days filed claim for lost luggage. I started calling air France every day, I got to speak with supervisor who made clear your bag was lost and there is no way for passenger to talk to claim department unless they call you. I asked how long it takes to get my reimbursement, he said, we have long queue and this might take several months. So they lost my bag with promise they will reimburse me when they decide to do with no timeframe. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris CDG,July 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,2.0,4,yes,6,"  We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change. Still, I live in hope that Air France ups its game on the service front."

I must have now called Air France a dozen times to find out the status of my claim. Each time, I get bounced around from one agent to another, each of whom appears completely unable to provide any help whatsoever. One agent today told me that the only way to communicate with AF is via social media and suggested I try Twitter and Facebook. I've already tried both of those months ago and never have had any response. I've now escalated the matter with my firm and with AMEX which did the booking as my company's corporate travel partner. Shame on Air France. I've never encountered such incompetence."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,August 2022,1.0,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  We just had a return flight scheduled via Air France on August 1st. We arrived 2.5 hours early to Charles de Gaulle but the bag drop-off took 1 hour then we were stopped for having carry-on bags too large at security and had to return to check the carry-ons, after this, we had 50 minutes until departure but security machine broke and caused abnormal security delays of an hour. We missed the flight. It then took 2 hours of waiting at Air France ticketing to learn the next flight would be 6 days away (with us having NO luggage). We opt for another flight on a different airline and airport but now to get our bags ... another 5 hours of waiting to get our 2 carry-on bags. We are told to return in the morning to pick up our other 2 large checked bags that had been pulled from the plane. We come back to CDG, wait 1.5 hours in a 5 person line to find out that those bags cannot be accessed, and they have to send them across the ocean and deliver to our home address. Unbelievable service from Air France. No apologies from anyone or care for the extraordinary mess of lines! One bag has been found but the other is untraceable."

Lounge welcome none, food not eatable, Champagne from a cheap brand. These are the only bad news from 2 flights that went smoothly, with excellent on-board service. 16 years old 777, retrofitted, but showing signals of usage. Small (14 seats) business class cabin, therefore very quiet. Connecting in CDG was made easy, with separate immigration for connecting passengers. Lounge in CDG was packed at 6:00 AM ! As usual MRS baggage delivery at MRS is a shame, with no respect for priority bags. Not AF fault; just bad service form third party services."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Paris ,August 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1," Vancouver to Paris. My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir. Avoid Air France's archaic customer service system at all costs."
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Rome to Lisbon Via Paris,June 2022,,,,,,3.0,1,no,1,"  Booked a business class flight from Rome to Lisbon Via Paris, completed online check-in, submitted the requested COVID Certificate, and received the Ready to Fly email from Air France, meaning everything I submitted was good to go. Arrived at the departing Airport only to be told that my seat was cancelled, my allocated seat was sold to another passenger, and it was now a sold-out flight. It's been a fight to get my refund. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Paris to Düsseldorf,June 2022,3.0,1.0,4.0,,,2.0,2,no,1,"  During the aircraft loading process, my suitcase was first placed next to the loading belt, then at some point scanned and placed on the back of the trolley that pulls the suitcase dolly (I could watch the whole process from the window the whole time). That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in Düsseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached. All in all very disappointing."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Paris,June 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My flight was canceled on June 17, 2022. It was supposed to depart at 11:55 pm and 30 minutes Before we were supposed to take off they canceled it and told us they are going to give us a hotel to stay in until they get us a new flight, but 4 hours waiting in the airport until they got us a hotel in Manhattan witch is an hour away from the airport. After that they told us to pay for everything we need and save a copy of the receipt and send it to the airline for a refund. I ended up paying around 300 dollars and I still haven’t gotten the money back and it’s been almost 2 months!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Punta Cana via Paris,July 2022,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  This airline have 2 people working at the check in counter where you get there early and spend more than 2 hours waiting on a line even tho they know your flight is about to leave and you need to pass through security. Also they are losing luggage, and if they find one of them was open (even when you put a lock on it) with a lot of missing items. They did not answer the claims made."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to New York ,July 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I make several international trips a year. This trips' flights with Air France were clearly the worst. We were only on this AF flight with our Delta reservations because of code sharing. Not only were the flight attendants condescending, food inedible and the ground service bizarre,  to add insult to injury, they lost our luggage and cannot locate it. AF's service desk is impossible to get on the phone. I have been trying for a day and a half since we returned to ask about the status of my missing luggage. We called Delta and after a wait of over an hour were told we should have called AF. Finally after a wait of over 2 hours we got a person to speak at AF -- the person manning the phones said they live in a status of perpetual wonderment as to where the luggage was and had certainly no idea where mine was. Frustration, upset, anger, disappointment. I will never fly Air France again. If you have an option, take another airline unless you can pack all your clothes in a carry on. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Washington, DC to Athens via Paris",June 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,1.0,2,no,1," We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had a 10 hour layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, “sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.” This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you. We were not the only people who spent the night at the airport, there were many families with kids who slept on the floor. Absolutely horrible the way they speak to you and also condescending."

The staff was really friendly and helpful, I had a problem with my entertainment device and they quickly fixed it for me. The food was good and the service was perfect, it was possible to ask for drinks or snacks for free which is a big plus. The ambient lights made the flight more enjoyable and the plane was beautiful. I had no problem to retrieve my luggage or to board my flight. I'll definitely fly with Air France again, thank you !"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320/A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Marseille to Montreal via paris,July 2022,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5,yes,9,"  Air France ground staff in Marseille were helpful as they anticipate our flight to CDG, in order to be sure that we would catch our transatlantic flight. However boarding at Marseille was one of the most messy I have ever seen, due to the lack of instructions of staff. Direct channel from Terminal 2F to Terminal 2E (K), with dedicated immigration and no security check was of great relief. Splendid. Catering at lounge was excellent. Boarding of flight to YUL was also a torture, as we had to wait under the sun (during the heat wave) on a ramp during more than 20 minutes. On the other hand service, food and comfort on AF A350 Business class were exceptional, showing a brutal improvement. Air France could have deserved a 10, if they had learned to board with SQ staff."

✅ Trip Verified ,A320/A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Lisbon via Paris,June 2022,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,3.0,5,yes,7,"  Online check-in and bag drop at Heathrow were straightforward, but the boarding procedure was cumbersome due to an apparent shortage of people at the gate (only 1 for most of the time). A gate between the queue to enter the departure lounge and the lounge itself was left open and one passenger managed to wander through, by-passing the gate agent. Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks). Probably because of the slow boarding process at Heathrow our first leg to CDG operated 25 minutes late, resulting in us having to sprint up and down staircases at CDG to catch our onward flight to Lisbon. Our baggage made it too -- phew! All in all this was a pleasant experience, especially onboard."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Chennai via Paris,June 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,2,no,3,  One of the worst baggage service I ever seen. I travelled on end of June and still not received my missing baggage. 10 days back Got a mail saying your baggage was found and it’s on your way but after I haven’t received any information from the airline. Very disappointed with the service. Now I have to travel back to my place without my bag.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to New York via Paris CDG,July 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  They have no process in place to smoothly inform people how to declare missing baggage and how to schedule a delivery. I've called the help line over 12 times and have been on hold for upwards of 45 minutes before the line hanging up on me. None of the support options seem to work and I've done my best to be patient, but I would really like an update. On the flight, we were given our meals and for an hour and a half, they let our trays sit there. They didn't pick up the trays for so long that people were helping each other out by holding their trash so they could move about the cabin. The flight attendants were nice, even if not very prompt. They seemed as upset about the situation as we were. I'm still on hold (day 2 trying to speak to someone) as I write this review. "

Air France staff was courteous, attentive and polite. The food was better than I could have imagined, we were served both dinner and breakfast. We flew on the Boeing 777-300ER first row in business class (First Class for this particular plane), the plane was a newer version, has ample leg room with an angled flat bed for comfortable seating. The aircraft was clean and everything in my seating area was in working order. My next trip back to Senegal will be with Air France!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Naples to Paris CDG via New York JFK,July 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Do not use Air France if you have another option! We were scheduled to leave Italy at 6.10 am on July 12, to catch a connecting flight in Paris to JFK. The night before they changed our flight to 7.45 am so we would miss our connecting flight. Instead of scheduling the next available flight from Paris to JFK, they changed our connecting flight multiple times and in the end, we had a 14 hour delay in the airport. No one communicated the reason for this long delay, we can only assume that they gave our seats away to the passengers that had already been stuck in the airport for 24-48 hours for a plane to JFK. The only compensation Air France offered us was a $31 food voucher for five passengers to hold us over for a fourteen hour delay. It is apparent that this airline is not at all prepared to accommodate the influx of passengers flying their airline and definitely does not respect their passengers time. We will never fly this airline again!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lyon to Venice via Paris,July 2022,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The tickets for our flight were bought online, yet at check-in, we were told the flight was full and that we had to board a different flight with a stop over at Amsterdam. We were originally going from Lyon to Venice. The new route costed us a delay of more than 2 hours. Each flight we boarded, or checked-in for, we were told they did not have a seat for us until everyone else had boarded. It felt like we had bought last-minute budget tickets and treated less than everybody else. Yet we had spent a large amount to travel to Venice. The entire journey we were still grateful we could fly and hopeful we could get to our destination. It was stressful to say the least. This has been a bad experience and I don't recommend Air France."

The flight was delayed for two hours and when we arrive, we had to wait for another hour to find that there was no luggage. It is now the 14/07/2022 and I still don't have my luggage! Last Saturday, I received a message saying the luggage was found. But I have not received the luggage yet. Therefore, and considering the very long time I have been without luggage and without actually managing to talk, exchange messages or even smoke signs with Air France, I found the company unreliable with a terrible customer service.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Newcastle via Paris,July 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,1,no,1,"  What a shambles and I will never fly with Air France again. This flight was 1.5 hours late, which seems normal for that flight.  AF had tried to throw me off my connecting flight and put me on one for the next day but the check-in girl at BKK managed to reverse it and I made the flight. I asked on exit how far away my next gate was but they didn’t have a clue. A 2-3-2 business class is decades out of date and the cabin crew were men who did their job in a minimalist manner but there was no friendliness or engagement with the passengers, downright miserable. The food felt very overly reheated. There looks like a lot of pages of movies but a lot of it was many copies of the same film, no idea what that was about as you choose your language when you click on play. They get round their terrible performance by using that awful and insulting catch-all phrase, “For operational reasons”. When we landed at CDG there was another plane still at our gate."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Birmingham ,June 2022,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,  My trip is over and I have still not received my bag. Horrible service. They do not answer phone calls or respond to emails. They literally left me high and dry. The fact that my holiday is over and still no correspondence from this retched airline I feel is reason enough not to fly with them. Honestly ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing time.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Paris,June 2022,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  The check in lines were long and there were not enough staff. The flight delayed for over an hour, more than 5 baggage were lost in a flight which causing a long queue on the luggage center. However, there were only two staff there. The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing. So basically if you take Air France and the baggage is lost during the flight, you will not be able to do anything and no one from Air France can help you."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Berlin,July 2022,3.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,3,no,5,"  I flew with Air France on flight AF1424 on 3rd July 2022 from Paris to Berlin. I knew there were cases of large queues for luggage check-ins and anticipating this, I left for the airport 4 hrs earlier and arrived 3.5hrs earlier than my flight time. And as expected, the line was huge. Despite the fact that they had automatic machines where you could check in your luggage, those machines opened late and 3-5 members of Air France were operating those counters. When the machines started running, people did not know how to use them. For example, if your bag were overweight by a certain threshold, the machine would get stuck. Thus, requiring human interference (or maybe people just didn’t know) to make it start working again. Secondly, the machine did not mention that you need to check in your hand luggage also. So, people had to come back from security. There was also a long line of people printing luggage tags after getting in line. Thus coming back and forth into the queues and stalling the people behind them. There were people just getting in line without waiting for their turn.  Some of the cabin crew were gloomy."

All we were told was to go to gate K57 and arrangements would be made. Only arrangement was made for business class passengers as if rest were travelling for free. Air France lounges denied entry even after many were ready to pay charges from pocket. It is 12.03 at night and no one from Air France has come."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Firenze to Paris,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5,yes,9,"  Thank you Air France for providing exceptional customer service. I read these reviews and they mostly appear to be only a bad experience. But my experience had the potential to be bad, but you handled it exceedingly well. My flight from Firenze to CDG was going to arrive late and I would miss my connection. In flight, the attendant told me I was going to miss the connection, my new flight was already booked for the next day, and that I would be provided a hotel and meals. When I arrived every word of this was true. I stayed in a very nice airport hotel (Golden Lotus) that provided exceptional buffet style food, I used the hotel shuttle, and you also gave me a meal voucher as well for the airport. I was concerned leaving my luggage overnight in the airport, but it arrived safely in LAX the following day. You could not have made this any easier, and I was really only delayed about 12 hours in total. I've flown with you 3 times now to Italy and you will always be my first choice. Yes, occasionally I may experience an inconvenience, but I will always remember how you handled this perfectly. My only suggestion for the foreign traveler would be maybe to have a printed map (handed to them by the flight attendant) with the details where the Air France Customer Service kiosk is located, and also where the hotel shuttles are located. It's such a huge airport and this took me a little time to navigate."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Paris via Tunis,June 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,3," I take a yearly trip to Tunisia, and I've flown with a lot of airlines over the years. I have encountered delays and issues with flight logistics but it was always handled smoothly and professionally by the airline. This time I tried Air France because they offered a trip without much waiting time before the corresponding flight, and what a huge mistake I made. First trip from Montreal to Paris was cancelled out of nowhere. No explanation was given and the only heads up I got was an email that was filtered as a spam since they sent it through a shady email. They rescheduled that flight for another one that got delayed for 2 hours. No heads up this time and of course no explanation. The cancellation and the delay made me miss my corresponding flight and instead of getting the first flight available to Tunis they booked me on a flight 13 hr after I land in Paris. I tried to find a solution with the airline's customer service in Paris Orly but according to them there was no flight before the one I had in 13hrs (even though there was and they scheduled it for some of the people in the line). The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter). Needless to say that this is my first and last trip with AF. I really recommend anybody flying long distance to avoid AF at all costs, they do not seem to be able to handle the logistics of a corresponding trip."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Nice,June 2022,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came. It still says “searching” on the claim; they haven’t found it. This experience has caused us so much unnecessary stress and anxiety. "

Of course the airline lost the luggage and now in Bordeaux they sent an email that one cannot respond to for sending the luggage to our hotel but they gave the wrong number to call back and cannot get in touch to coordinate the lost bag reaching our hotel. 2 days after landing in Bordeaux still no bag. Stay away from this airline, I will never book with them again."

The flat bed was more like a recliner seat and my food was not up to the quality. Flight back from Paris to LAX took off late and I was very hungry. Flight attendant gave me menu, I chose salmon, she mentioned that is not available since it has been taken. No issues but when I paid a premium to travel business, should not I expect better. Given vegetarian which was very salty."

The wonderful ladies at the Air France counter at the airport were, through determined shuffling, able to accommodate all of us on the next flight to Vancouver. There was otherwise a real possibility that some of would have had to stay overnight. Kudos to the attentiveness of the Air France agents!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Osaka to Rome via Paris,May 2022,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3,yes,7,"  Osaka to Rome via Paris. I chose to travel with Air France  because it was the ""cheapest"" and the ""shortest"" route. I would recommend flying with them as the trip was ok, but there are things to improve! Duration of the first flight is 15 hours. Although I was worried for this very long trip, time passed quickly aboard. I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !! A particular appreciation for a female flight attendant on the flight from Osaka, and a male flight attendant on the flight to Rome. Both very kind and helpful."

We were behind schedule when we landed at CDG with only a small chance of making our connecting flight that day. My wife made it to the correct gate and was able to board while I ended up at the wrong gate. I would like to offer a huge thank you to Captain Emmanuel Rollier who insisted the plane would not leave until I arrived at the plane. The rest of the crew were equally supportive and helped create a positive ending to what had been a very stressful day. Thanks again to Captain and crew.

Old airplane. They asked if I wanted chicken or pasta. I said pasta. They said we don’t have it and left. It’s a disgusting airline.

I think without the help of this gentleman, it wouldn't have been possible for us to board the flight. Mr Sunil helped us till the last moment and ensured that we board the flight. He did everything which a customer needs during any technical hitches which is not known to the passenger. Hats off to such a committed and helping person.  He really made our day in the time of crisis and now I have landed Toronto without any hassles. "

A smooth and hassle-free flight on a brand new plane. The Airbus A220 is comfortable and offers free WIFI for Whatsapp and other messengers. Air France gives you a free small sandwich and a drink of your choice, alcoholic beverages included. Airport services were also fine. Check-in and security check in CDG took only a few minutes and in Berlin I got my luggage within 5 minutes. I think currently AF is the best airline in Europe."
Not Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Sint Maarten,June 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,"  Was pleasantly surprised with Air France as I was expecting the worst experience. The aircraft felt up to date, entertainment system worked fine and had plenty of choices. Crew were very friendly and personally greeted us and asked if we needed anything. The meal services were great, the main meal was the best one I had in economy for quite sometime as mostly they are inedible but this was good, chicken with mushrooms and polenta, a small salad with Camargue rice and a delicious small pastry for dessert, coffee and wine. The meal service before landing was presented in a small gift bag and contents were tasty, a nice touch I thought."

This caused us to miss our connection. Each time Air France made it incredibly difficult to rebook. We had to wander CDG airport where no one was there to assist, when we found the Air France desk they were understaffed and waited hours in line to get a new flight. This is all with our 5 month old son. Horrible attitudes and no sense of urgency in trying to get us home. They also lost one of my bags on the initial trip which was returned. However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent. I will never take any airline that connects in CDG and will absolutely avoid Air France at all costs. The flight attendants were great and the only positive interactions we had were with them."

To begin with, no matter what's the actual price difference, I was asked to pay an amount of money that equal/ed the price of the full ticket at minimum. Eventually, I decided to accept it and was going to pay to change the ticket for my return flight. while I was shown several options, only a tiny percentage were available to book, maybe 30%. All the rest gave a system error and a message to call their hotline, which cost me a lot of wasted time. When I called the hotline, they told the flight was available, but cost more than the full price of a one way ticket. The actual flight was OK, but this rebooking experience was so disappointing and time consuming that I cannot help but to give KLM a 0."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London Heathrow via Paris,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  Awful customer service, who are clearly trained to keep you in a loop of confusion, in hope that you give up on whatever it is you need help with. Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong. It amazes me that big companies like Air France can get away with having no customer service whatsoever."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Toronto,June 2022,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,,1.0,3,no,1," Paris to Toronto. I spent the last 3 weeks travelling to different parts of Europe. I have taken 5 flights total, including my flight home with Air France. I am extremely disappointed with the airport and baggage situation. I arrived at the airport and had my luggage that was not overweight and my carry on luggage that was 12kg as required and purse. I checked my luggage in and proceeded to the security. When arriving at security they weighed my carry on and indicated I had to add my purse on top. Due to my purse and carry on luggage being 14kg together. They stated my carry on or purse needed to be paid for and put through baggage or I needed to remove items and throw them out. I had to go all the way back and pay for my carry on luggage that did not have a lock and had valuable items in it to be put through with baggage. I spent 85 euros that I had no intention in spending as I ensured to make my luggage and carry on for the weight requirements. I’m extremely disappointed that this occurred and felt it was very uncalled for as this has been the only airline who requires a shoulder purse to be weighted."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Geneva to Buenos Aires via Paris ,May 2022,2.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  First leg GVA-CDG was delayed due to circumstances outside of AF's control, I completely understand. But I still managed to get to the gate to my CDG-EZE flight with just 5-10 minutes delay. we arrived to find the plane still at the gate but boarding closed. So AF's team had to deny boarding to the 20+ passengers that arrived just a few minutes late. We were then sent to the AF counter AND were assigned a hotel some 40 minutes drive from the airport (this was almost midnight by then). We were told a shuttle would take us to the hotel. We come out to an empty parking lot, no shuttle in sight. In the end we had to google the hotel's name and pay for a uber to take us there. We arrive to the hotel (which was partially under construction) at around 1AM, and the hotel manager has no idea if and when AF will send a shuttle to bring me back to the airport. AF set me in an Iberia flight via Madrid, so I had to be back at the airport at 5.30AM.  I make it back to the airport, to find out my luggage was not transferred by AF to Iberia, so I would have to leave without it. I spent the next week in Argentina without my luggage, unsuccessfully trying to get information from AF and/or Iberia."

The window seat is spacious with very much room for ones feet (perfect in flat bed mode) and very comfy. I slept very well. Privacy could be a little bit better but will be improved with the new suite type of seats for B777. IFE: Screen size and selection are good, picture quality is not on par with modern systems - but of course you can not expect this. The crew has been very friendly and helpful, food was plenty and delicious with a great starter (picture) and one of the best steaks I ever had on board (sorry, forgot to take a picture). Check in in SFO was very slow (almost 40 minutes for 12 people) but otherwise no complaints. Lounge was small and crowded, but food, beverages and WIFI were very good. I really liked the whole experience and appreciated the attentive and cordial service on board. Well done, Air France. I am looking forward to fly with you again long haul."

Six months now and no resolution to a delayed baggage claim for purchasing incidentals totaling about $350. I will travel back to W.

Shameful and inexcusable on the part of Air France."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris,May 2022,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1,no,1," Abuja to Amsterdam via Paris. Very disrespectful to their customers. Initially, the return flight was booked for a Saturday evening. But 2 months in advance Air France cancelled the flight. Since there was only one flight a day, we had to reschedule for the Sunday flight. Air France did not want to book a hotel or pay (part of the extra hotel costs). On check-in at Abuja, check-in was denied, because the flight was scheduled for the day before (Saturday), doh. Even though I was carrying the ticket with the new date, the booking confirmation and the e-mail about the cancellation, they refused boarding. At long last, the ticket office printed a new ticket for Sunday, and informed us, that they would not charge us at this time. On arrival in Paris, there was a technical problem with the bridge, which delayed the flight by half an hour. Air France staff refused to assist to help us catch the connecting flight. As a result, we missed the flight. At the transfer counter, the helpful staff informed us of this fact, as if we were to blame for it. On arrival in Amsterdam, of course, our bags were missing. We claimed the missing bags immediately. It took Air France a full week, to deliver the bags (from Paris to Amsterdam). When they eventually delivered the bags, one was damaged (broken handle). We also claimed the damage on the handle immediately. So far it has been 3 weeks, and Air France is not responding to any requests, nor handling our damage claim. I would row a boat to Nigeria than fly with an airline that is so disinterested in their customers. Never again."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Havana,May 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2,no,3,"  Very poor meals for a 10hour flight (Paris CDG to Havana). They provided one meal ~1.5 hours after the take off and then we were starving as the last one was ~1.5 before landing. Both were unsatisfactory for such a long flight, equal to those offered in 3 hour flights of other airlines such Aegean. Also one of the flight attendants woke us up (4 people) at 4.30am while everyone was sleeping because she wanted to find her bag. She first opened the cases above our seats and after she realized that her bag was not there she poked the person sitting on the outermost seat to ask where is the bag and “why” it’s not there, loudly and visibly annoyed. So rude. For the record, the bag was in the next (front) case but I guess it’s easier to ask someone instead of looking a little further."

Having waited for a while in Mumbai for my suitcase, I finally made it to the counter to file a claim.  It took me 4 hours to get out of the airport trying to file a claim for the missing baggage. The Air France representative  Mr. Akash was nothing but polite, courteous, and a star that worked under pressure. Whilst the process was disorganized and lacked manpower, he was single-handedly managing AF travelers.  I hope they track and manage to deliver my luggage on time. "

Started off well with excellent check in at first at t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies. Watch out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October. As always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots."
Not Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Keflavik to London Heathrow,December 2022,2.0,3.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19th. On the face of it, that was sensible as the weather in Iceland was appalling. However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport. I got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad. If they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed. I am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins. Having checked today, as I type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to Keflavík being closed! Do they not check these things? Any help from BA offered - not really."
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Frankfurt,October 2022,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  BA cancelled my flight home, the last flight of the day into Heathrow, and tried to push me onto another flight to London City 3 hours later! My car was at Heathrow. I didn't want to try and cross London late at night on public transport with luggage, especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time. I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all be it another terminal) on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on. It's such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience. BA have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey we've booked this year. We are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service."

Long queues at security due to only 4 lines open. People stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded. Missed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next one. Received a voucher, approx £6 for the whole day. Arrived 1 day later, my suitcase didn’t arrive with me. Filed a claim at the desk, for 5 days no update, no information, no offer of compensation and no solution offer. I now have a spoilt holiday, many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don’t know if I will be reimbursed. Beware with BA, expect low level or zero customer service, old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing. I will personally avoid BA in future at all costs."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London Gatwick to Cancun,November 2022,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Boarding – at gate at LGW they called Group 1 to board (we were World Traveller Plus & Group 3), then called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward. Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew. We will not be looking to fly BA over Virgin in future."

I arrived back in Phoenix on Sunday evening and air tags showed my bags arrived on Monday, but it took three more days before they were finally delivered. I understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in London my luggage did not make it onto my final flight. I filled out the required form at the Phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where I received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email, but no email was received. I made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and I should hear back within 24 hours. Finally the email with the tracking number was received on Tuesday night. I went online with the tracking number on Wednesday and it requested that I provide the same information that I had given them on the form at the airport. My luggage was finally delivered on Thursday afternoon. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,London to Rome,December 2022,4.0,4.0,5.0,,4.0,1.0,4,yes,6,"  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class. She kept touching her face, not making eye contact with passengers, and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there."

About six months ago BA announced they were switching planes to the old antique push-me-pull-you layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics. Sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room (eight seats across), worn out fittings, inedible food and surly FAs."

I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better. I've obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades, but everything else was good."

Excellent service, attentive staff, first drink service, then meal service (choice of three meals), later second drink service. In reality - excellent flight. Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet). Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve. Constantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet). I don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you. I was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes-like bites and some drink. Why would we bother serving you also a scone. Hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when I asked for my scone it came as a surprise I was not served any (no co-ordination between the crew).  Crew busy chatting at the galley. In reality - the service could not get any worse. One just must ask what do you pay the premium price for? "

What outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldn't even order any food / drink because the card reader didn't function. The first and last time we'll fly with BA.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Business,Economy Class,Denver to London,December 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I was flying to Warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami the next day. Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there. I mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami the next day.

It took a while but BA did eventually make good on their promise, thank you. Based on things now being resolved I have travelled on BA since and I am booked to travel to South Africa in First class on 2nd January, looking forward to the new BA Concorde lounge. Keep it up BA, loyalty is indeed a 2way street."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to London,November 2022,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2,no,2," Extremely sub-par service. Highlights: No online meal selection. Staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. Last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. Plates were literally grabbed away. I had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. No apology. No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. Staff walked down with some water and biscuits. This got exhausted just before she got to me. She just looked at me and walked away. Nothing further was offered."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Lisbon,November 2022,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,3.0,3,yes,7,"  I virtually gave up on British Airways about three years ago, writing off my Avios and opting for other airlines. But my return flights from Heathrow to Lisbon this week were very good. The aircraft were pretty much full, but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good. A particular shout-out to a flight attendant called Jo, but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive. I'm going to have to start spending those Avios."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787 / A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Edinburgh via London Heathrow,January 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"  I was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather. The flight from Montreal was my return flight to Scotland, but I originally booked to fly to and from Toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and I rebooked for a cheaper flight. The inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. As well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. While the food was typical air plane food. I thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Budapest via London,November 2022,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  British Airways is late, their website is atrocious, and they wouldn't let me check-in until 24 hours before the flight. I have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website, and/or find a real person to speak with. Customer service had such a thick accent I didn't think they were speaking English. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Amman Jordan to London UK (Heathrow),November 2022,3.0,2.0,1.0,,,4.0,2,no,4, Flew from Amman to London on Nov. 14 2022. Not sure what type of aircraft it was. My Ticket was economy plus. The flight is 5h35m. We received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. The seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. Any other food or drink had to be purchased. So we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. It is the third time I have flown with BA recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. Will honestly never fly them again if I can help it.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dusseldorf to London via Los Angeles,August 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1," This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Cape Town,November 2022,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,1,no,2,"  Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. LHR T5 smooth and calm. Checking process quick. - But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  Ran back to checkin to get correct one. Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). Overall experience 2/10. Flew Air France (Fortalaza to CDG to LHR) two weeks earlier which was way better. How embarrassing for BA."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Dallas via London ,November 2022,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1,no,1," Worst experience ever. Outbound flight was cancelled and I was not notified. I was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip. Inbound flight delayed 1 hour, also not notified. On top of it, they boarded my hand luggage, which was the only bag I had. Extra wait in Milan then. Food is horrible."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baltimore to London Heathrow,November 2022,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,2.0,3,yes,5,"  Check in was a shambles at BWI, just 3 counters open for a very full flight. The bag drop queue was even longer than the regular check-in queue! Boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! The plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to T5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. Overall, I rate this just as a mediocre journey."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Dubai to Belfast via London,October 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1,no,1, Beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to BA. Two pieces reported 29th September. BA responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. All this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world. Disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Bologna via London,July 2022,5.0,5.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1," On July 19th 2022 I had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that BA had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to Italy and we've lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them, for which I had provided all copy of receipts for. I requested for my expenses to be reimbursed, they agreed, I sent all requested information and was told in 2 weeks I will be receiving it. It's 4 months later and British Airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow-ups on the matter."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to London,October 2022,,,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  I booked the flight on Oct 8, but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that I can't get my entry visa in time for the flight. And I did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. But in the cancellation email, the booking reference number is a different one. So I requested cancellation, but BA canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email? I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! And it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to BA. I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. Based on my experience, no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put in. Given all I have experienced, I have zero faith in British Airways."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Gibraltar,October 2022,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,3.0,3,no,6,  London to Gibraltar on 25th October 2022. I booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  BA attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. Offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where BA aim to be positioned at of late. The A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. The staff disappeared for most of the flight. The flight was punctual but I felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience. 
Not Verified ,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Nairobi,October 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  I’ve generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with BA if they fly the route I’m after but my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. We should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr + flight. Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. They were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board. We’re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in July for the cancellation of our flight to Miami in March. This was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight !"
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-1000,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Los Angeles,October 2022,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5,yes,9,"  A great flight. The suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort. British has returned to full service so meals were coursed, menus and hot towels provided…etc Food was quite good with choices provided for both meals. Service was ok, I prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference. Entertainment was good as was connectivity. No real complaints except a minor one. The tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position. I actually felt like I was in a true business class, not by Qatar’s standards, but that’s another story."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Copenhagen to Heathrow,October 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4.0,5,yes,9,"  I am happy to say that this flight was quite good. Except for the second rate Euro business seating, everything was very well done. A friendly, informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about Heathrow transit. Well done. Unfortunately, a bus gate was used upon arrival."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Larnaca to London,October 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,2,no,3,"  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-10,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Atlanta to London,October 2022,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4,yes,9,"  A very positive experience with BA. Seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep. Food was fine but not outstanding. Wi-Fi good, and video screen large and bright. Baggage came out very quickly at Heathrow, had the same experience on the return flight to Atlanta. All in all, would fly BA again, but would probably want to make sure it is new seats."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Madrid to San Francisco via London,September 2022,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,,3.0,1,no,2," Baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered. A380 is a great aircraft but the BA seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)"
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Washington,October 2022,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,,2.0,5,yes,8,"  Evening flight from LHR to IAD on an A380. Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. Boarding was very poorly managed. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. The IFE was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and TV programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. The seat was comfortable but legroom was tight. All in, it was an uneventful journey and I would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to San Francisco,October 2022,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1,no,1,"  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,October 2022,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,4.0,1,no,3,"  While entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that I was suffocating. I got faint due to that heat, but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time. Other then that when I called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 777-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Los Angeles,October 2022,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,4,yes,7,"  LHR-LAX. I prefer the Boeing 777 over the A380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. Check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at Heathrow. T5 is a whole other story. Once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. I have been in and out of Heathrow many times but never in T5 before. Anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. It was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so I occupied my time with several movies. Nice landing at LAX. All in all BA was just fine."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Miami to London Heathrow,October 2022,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,,4.0,3,yes,8,"  Flew back to UK from Miami in new Club World Suite - a huge improvement on the elderly Yin and Yang style Club World. Boarding easy. Took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. Very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FA's - especially Anna who addressed me by name). However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. Refused to pay BA's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. C'mon BA - do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class ? I can recommend BA's new Club Class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Dubai to London,October 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3,yes,9,  I flew with hand baggage but security at Dubai was quick. Entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound. Flight on A380 left on time. Few technical issues with IFE which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight. Decent snack and slept well. Arrivals lounge excellent. Would recommend.
Not Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Cairo,October 2022,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,4.0,1,no,1," London to Cairo. First, on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water. Even Southwest is more generous. When unable to connect my phone to order food, I hit the FA call button with no response for more than an hour. When the FA came to collect garbage I had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter. He used his phone to place the order."

Not Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to London,September 2022,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,4.0,3,yes,6,"  DFW-LHR. Had an easy transfer at DFW from American Airlines to British Airways heading to London. First ride on an A380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice. Was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very cramped. When the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. The seat itself wasn't too bad but I felt squished and locked in. On a plus side, having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side. Ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice. Plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night. Dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack. The entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies, tv, music and games. All in all it was an OK experience and did get me to London on time and our baggage arrived safely, but I'm not sold on the A380. T5 at LHR is another story that will be in a different review. What a mess that place is."
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Jersey to London Heathrow,September 2022,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,3.0,4,yes,7,  Check in at Jersey straightforward. There is a small business class lounge at Jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food. Flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at LHR. Captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at Heathrow. Good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served. Disappointing that the wait for cases at Heathrow T5 was as long as the flight!
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Jersey,September 2022,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,3.0,4,yes,8,"  Check in at LHR T5 was very quick and queue for security short. We used the South Lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. Flight boarded on time. Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Glass of champagne, Coronation Chicken Salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter. In spite of some of the issues with BA, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception. Flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to London Heathrow,September 2022,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,3.0,2,no,3," The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to New York JFK,September 2022,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5,yes,9," This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Gothenburg to Jersey via London,June 2022,2.0,2.0,,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow - Jersey. However, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel to my destination. If I have a choice, I will never travel BA again. Such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs."

My flight into London was delayed, security had long lines, I ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board (the software program was already closed). This while the flight manager, who came towards the gate, urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line. I was sweating from the run, still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board. I bolted again into the plane feeling bad that I did not personally thank her for her magic. I really hope she gets recognized by British Airways for her performance. Thank you for all you do !"

British Airways Business Class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty. Front rows about 5-7 are considered as Business Class, with very short leg space.

First of all, the improvement in the BA lounge in Gatwick is massive. The buffet was a joy. We flew on a BA flight but operated by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service. I am still not clear on luggage being labelled ""priority"". The luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports."

Today I clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a fee. I then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately I received a response saying my voucher is on its way. I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. So they now have my money and I have to re-book at full cost. In the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up."

They cancelled my return flight from Heathrow back to Manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered. We had to get our son come all the way to London to pick us up and take us to our car in Manchester. The food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night. I will not be flying BA again

We found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. We had to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. We returned home with Aer Lingus with no drama."

She greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile, she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books. Her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing. She had time for a quick chat and I think she said she was half German and half Bulgarian, a really lovely young lady who is a credit to British Airways."

They delay my transfer to the next day, okay, not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test, but when I try to check in at Changi Airport, the Philippines Airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test. Had to rush to a different terminal, get tested, wait for the result, rush back to check in ...the gate had closed.  Had to book an extra night in Singapore hotel, book my own flight to Manila, then also the return journey back to London. If one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  I discovered Oman Air Business Class and better then British Airways, from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Barcelona,June 2022,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from Heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, I boarded the plane on this basis. I was subsequently dumped at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. There was no help at there to find a hotel. I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers. So for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with BA."

Let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to London and missed our connecting flight back to NY. The reason writing this review is the great customer service that Kashmir Dhami gave us. She was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day, which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult, but she got it done! She is so kind and is amazing at her job."

Just got off the call with him, after their arrival at Heathrow. Shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and I have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from RSA, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. My grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignored. Last one was told ""wait till drinks are served!"" Then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it Sir"", that sealed it for us, if that’s the BA response to what’s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate."

At our arrival in Amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at London Heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in Amsterdam, this was 3 days ago and we still don't have the suitcase or any information about it. Today I travelled from Amsterdam to London City Airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when I arrived in London, the suitcase was missing, left in Amsterdam. 2 Suitcases, 2 different flights, they've ruined my holidays. No compensation, no dates on when will I get my property back, no information, lies and more lies.  I was told I could complain online and buy all the things I need, shoes, toiletries, clothes, and I might receive the money back in 30 days! Yes, I might."

Do not be taken in by this marketing con - they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises. Some things just do not change at BA.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nairobi to New York via London,July 2022,3.0,5.0,3.0,,,3.0,1,no,2,"  Customer service is non-existent. For over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks. Nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on BA.com I was flying to Nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly, My sister and husband had tickets on the July 18 from Nairobi to JFK. When BA received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister's ticket, not once but twice. It took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence. My niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times. 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back. The ticket was in premium economy. When I tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. Where is the efficiency? Where is the empathy? Where is the decency? In addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight. Also when I made my reservation, i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a $1400.00 increase. British Airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion. Words simply don't convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company"

If you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone. Or like me you can pre-order weeks before you fly. However there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane, that someone was me it turned out. They also managed to lose my luggage.  I am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it. I will never use them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to Washington via London,July 2022,2.0,2.0,2.0,,,1.0,1,no,1,"  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line. This ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the UK. "
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Amsterdam via London,June 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,1.0,1,no,1,"  Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands. Seems British Airways claims & refund process is non responsive, as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation, but received nothing yet. apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight.

Meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley - could they have offered to serve this afterwards? Seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight. Cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldn't sleep even if the seats were comfortable. This was so disrespectful and inconsiderate.
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Reykjavik,May 2022,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,1.0,4,yes,5,"  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor."

They were booked many months ago and eligible for the Travel Voucher, so I opted for this online. Since then, absolute silence and BA pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). As a very loyal BA customer for more than 40 years, I am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays. With a further 6 bookings with BA planned for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Toronto,July 2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,5,yes,10,  Flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down.

Within 24 hours our luggage arrived in Toronto and a wonderful BA representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me. Would definitely give BA a 5 star rating and have them again.

Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight."

My husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight. We were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip (after spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc). When we finally rebooked we still lost one day, one day of lodging, and tickets to a show. We tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us. No one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money. We are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here!"

British Airways has given me such grief, trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away, they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking. It is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight, and I have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours I have spent on hold, or with an agent, being told that my query has been prioritized and that I will receive a call back within 48 hours. I call every 2-3 days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation. I will never book with BA again. Sure, flying with them is easy, but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time. And to think I spent more money on a ticket with BA than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier. BIG MISTAKE"

All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim""). BA doesn't seem to have anything like this. In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag. I hadn't flown BA in many years and with experience I would never book them again."
Not Verified ,"A320, Boeing 787",Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Venice to Baltimore via London Heathrow,July 2022,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2,no,4,"  British Airways is poorly staffed at Venice airport. No one to check in 2 flights departing within 15 minutes of each other 1.5 hours before. Huge line snaking through airport. Flight crew fine. London to Baltimore segment on an older 787, usually they are much nicer. Limited TV and movie selections, wifi did not work. Flight crew ok, food adequate."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,London to Nairobi,June 2022,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight for myself and my wife from Heathrow to Nairobi in Premium Economy using Frequent Flyer points. I then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as I didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles. When I asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation, they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable. I read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats, but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable."
