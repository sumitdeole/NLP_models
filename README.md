# Exploring airline reviews using NLP models
In this project, we will extract insights from user reviews on a number of European airlines. The investigation comprises of two major exercises:
1. Get the user review data from skytrax on the four major European airlines (code is in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FPgk5Qnu1nSOJinU5Ltt__P6-QfUAsyA?usp=sharing)).
2. Import, clean and perform the sentiment analyses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules in Python. The code is present in this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ll3suRJhaUMPKwqdWk2LpQs4oUx9Pqoh#scrollTo=zOl8YaxDmC_E). We will cover four different NLP approaches and evaluate their performance:
    - **TextBlob** 
    - **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
    - **RoBERTa** - pretrained model, including Huggingface pipeline
    - **Flair framework** - Read more information [here](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair).
