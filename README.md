# Exploring airline reviews using NLP models
This project will extract insights from user reviews of European airlines. The investigation comprises of two major exercises:
1. Get the user review data from Skytrax on the four major European airlines (code is in this [notebook](https://github.com/sumitdeole/nlp_models/blob/main/Scrape_airlines_reviews.ipynb)).
2. Import, clean, and perform the sentiment analyses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules in Python. The code is present in this [notebook](https://github.com/sumitdeole/nlp_models/blob/main/NLP_airline_reviews.ipynb). We will cover four different NLP approaches and evaluate their performance:
    - **TextBlob** 
    - **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
    - **RoBERTa** - a pre-trained model, including the Huggingface pipeline
    - **Flair framework** - Read more information [here](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair).
